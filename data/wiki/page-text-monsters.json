Numerous Doubts are summoned during the first battle by [[The Inadequacy]], and represent the protagonist of the quest, [[Cyrisus]], and his little nagging doubts about combat. Though they can be fought and killed with ease, it is recommended that players do not attempt to kill them and instead focus only on the main fight. All spawned Doubts will disappear once The Inadequacy is killed. Players can, however, take advantage of the Doubts by using [[blood spells]] on them to heal hitpoints.\n\n==Strategy==\nPlayers should remember to turn [[auto-retaliate]] off whilst fighting The Inadequacy. Otherwise, players may start fighting the Doubts that are also attacking them. The Inadequacy has a higher max hit making a Doubt undesirable to attack. It's best to leave a Doubt seeing as they're highly inaccurate and do not hit very high.\n\n==Habitat==\n*[[Dream World]]\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Dream Mentor}}\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

They frequently drop large amounts of [[Herbs|grimy herbs]] and [[herb seed]]s. Because of this, bringing a [[herb sack]] and [[seed box]] when killing them is recommended.\n\n[[Deviant spectre]]s, found in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], can be killed in their place if you are assigned aberrant spectres.\n\n==Locations==\n\n*Morytania [[Slayer Tower]] ({{FloorNumber|2}})\n*[[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n'''A [[nose peg]] or [[slayer helmet]] is required when fighting aberrant spectres; if you do not, they will use a special attack which will always hit, even through [[Prayer]], and drain your combat stats extremely quickly. Boosts cannot be used to equip a nose peg so level 60 Slayer or a slayer helmet is required.'''\n\nThey attack using [[Magic]], so the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer can be helpful, or players can wear [[dragonhide armour]]. Using a [[Salve amulet]]\u00a0or [[Salve amulet (e)]] will give you a large advantage, since they are an [[undead]] monster. However, bonuses do not stack with a [[slayer helmet]]/[[black mask]]. It should also be noted that using Protect from Magic does not counter their stat-reducing abilities.\u00a0\n\n'''Note:''' It is possible to use a [[dwarf multicannon]] inside the [[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]. This is recommended for fastest Slayer experience.\n\nIt's possible to safespot in the [[Slayer Tower]] by standing on the brick pile just west of the [[Agility]] chain shortcut and pulling spectres just in front of the suit of armour from the room south of the shortcut. A [[crossbow]]'s [[rapid]] attack style will be able to target aberrant spectres from this distance, making it a very useful spot.\n\nIt is also possible to [[safespot]] one of the aberrant spectres by using the south-eastern corner of the wall of the staircase-room. This only works with [[Ranged]] or Magic, as there has to be at least six spaces between the player and the aberrant spectre before the player gets out of the spectre's attack range. It's not possible to use [[halberd]]s or thrown weapons such as [[throwing knives]] and [[throwing axe]]s without getting hit as their attack range is not long enough. In addition, the safespots are only usable when the spectres are non-aggressive due to nearby spectres attacking the player and preventing them from killing the trapped spectre.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=820736}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Aberrant spectre}}\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Lava battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic robe bottom (dark)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|override=There is a 78/128 chance of rolling the [[herb drop table]].

While admiring the other world, [[Vespula]] flew through the portal and attacked Xeric's crew, who fled the scene. Vespula now controls the area and tends to her offspring while protecting the portal.\n\nPlayers can destroy the portal if they encounter Vespula. If the portal is destroyed, Vespula and her offspring will die as well, ending the encounter. However, attacking the portal when Vespula is flying will cause her to enrage, attacking nearby players; she will stop flying once she reaches 23% of her Hitpoints, making it safer to attack the portal. If any of her [[lux grub]]s grow into [[vespine soldier]]s, Vespula and the abyssal portal will both regain hitpoints. If under attack the abyssal portal will drain the prayer points of players standing in range by three points every two ticks; if prayer points are already depleted, then three damage will applied instead. \n\nThe portal is at least [[Attack range|eight tiles]] away from the accessible area, therefore some weapons require long-range attack options. [[Armadyl crossbow]] and [[twisted bow]] may be used on rapid attack style due to their longer range. While the portal does not attack the players itself, it has a high [[Magic]] level, making twisted bow perform exceptionally well.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being thought for a long time to have no attack, it actually retaliates with a very faint projectile when attacked\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chambers of Xeric}}",

Although it resides in a multi-combat area, it is a solo-only boss.\n\nAccording to [[The Overseer]], the Abyssal Sires are the engineers of the Abyss from a time before the God Wars. As their resources began to deplete and they had no means to escape, they constructed the Nexus and remained there in deep stasis.\n\nThe Sire is located in the [[Abyssal Nexus]], south of the [[Abyss]] used for [[Runecraft]]. It can be safely entered via the [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DIP}} (if the player has access to them), or it can be accessed via the Abyss although this drains the player's [[Prayer|prayer points]], if not wearing an [[Abyssal bracelet]], and [[Skull (status)|skulls]] them. There are four chambers in the Nexus where Sire can be found, allowing multiple people to fight the Sire per world, similar to [[Cerberus]].\n\n[[Random events]] cannot occur in the Sire's chamber; any random events following the player will be automatically dismissed entering appropriate range. Players in invalid tiles when a Sire is dormant will result in teleportation to the centre of the chamber.\n\nIt is known for dropping the [[Unsired]], which is then used at the [[Font of Consumption]] behind [[The Overseer]] to get a chance of obtaining an [[abyssal whip]], [[abyssal dagger|dagger]], [[abyssal head]], [[jar of miasma]] and untradeable parts of the [[abyssal bludgeon]] - the [[bludgeon axon]], [[bludgeon claw]], and [[bludgeon spine]], as well as a very small chance at the [[Abyssal orphan]].\n\nAs with all demons, the Sire is susceptible to the effects of [[demonbane weapons]].\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{main|Abyssal Sire/Strategies}}\n\nThe fight consists of three phases:\n*The first phase focuses on killing the Sire's four respiratory systems on the sides of the room that heal the Sire. This is easily done by using [[Shadow spells]] on the [[Ancient Magicks|ancient spellbook]] to disorientate Sire to take down the respiratory systems.\n*At the start of the second phase, the Sire gets off his throne to attack the player with melee. He may also summon [[Spawn]]s and create highly poisonous miasma pools under the player. The Spawns are quite harmless at first, but they will mature into [[Scion]]s after ten seconds who have more health and deal more damage.\n*When the Sire reaches 50% health, he will walk to the middle of the room to initiate the third phase. Instead of attacking himself, he rapidly summons miasma pools, which the player should avoid. When the Sire reaches less than 33% health, it will teleport the player next to him and trigger a highly damaging area-of-effect attack, which can be avoided by running away as soon as the player is teleported. He will also summon many spawns to attack the player. After the player finishes the Sire off, any spawns and scions will die alongside him.\n\nUpon defeat, the Sire respawns instantly.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=40840}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:ASunique|{{#expr:\n(1/100) * 1/128 * (\n  26 * {{GEP|Abyssal dagger}} +\n  12 * {{GEP|Abyssal whip}} +\n  13 * {{GEP|Jar of miasma}} +\n  62/3 * {{GEP|Abyssal bludgeon}}\n)\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:ASconsumables|{{#expr:\n99/100 * 1/139 * (\n  7 * {{GEP|Chilli potato|10}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Super restore(4)|4}} +\n  2 * {{GEP|Saradomin brew(3)|6}}\n)\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:ASregulartable|{{#expr:\n99/100 * 1/139 * (\n  6 * {{GEP|Battlestaff|10}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Rune full helm|3}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Mystic lava staff|2}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Rune sword|3}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Rune platebody|2}} +\n  3 * {{GEP|Rune kiteshield|2}} +\n  2 * {{GEP|Mystic air staff|2}} +\n  2 * {{GEP|Air battlestaff|6}} +\n\n  5 * 1/125 * (\n    15 * {{GEP|Ranarr seed|2}} +\n    14 * {{GEP|Snapdragon seed|2}} +\n    11 * {{GEP|Torstol seed|2}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Watermelon seed|30}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Willow seed|2}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Mahogany seed|2}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Maple seed|2}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Teak seed|2}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Yew seed|2}} +\n    7 * {{GEP|Papaya tree seed|2}} +\n    6 * {{GEP|Magic seed|2}} +\n    5 * {{GEP|Palm tree seed|2}} +\n    4 * 0 + <!-- spirit seed -->\n    3 * {{GEP|Dragonfruit tree seed|2}} +\n    2 * {{GEP|Celastrus seed|2}} +\n    2 * {{GEP|Redwood tree seed|2}}\n  ) +\n\n  5 * 1/35 * (\n    10 * {{GEP|Grimy kwuarm|25}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Grimy dwarf weed|25}} +\n    9 * {{GEP|Grimy cadantine|25}} +\n    7 * {{GEP|Grimy lantadyme|25}}\n  ) +\n\n  5 * {{GEP|Death rune|350}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Blood rune|200}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Law rune|250}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Soul rune|250}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Cosmic rune|350}} +\n\n  3 * 1/70 * (\n    10 * {{GEP|Air talisman}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Body talisman}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Earth talisman}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Fire talisman}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Mind talisman}} +\n    10 * {{GEP|Water talisman}} +\n    4 * {{GEP|Cosmic talisman}} +\n    3 * {{GEP|Chaos talisman}} +\n    3 * {{GEP|Nature talisman}}\n  ) +\n\n  11 * 50000 * 1 + <!-- coins -->\n  6 * {{GEP|Coal|400}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Pure essence|600}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Earth orb|50}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Magic logs|60}} +\n  5 * {{GEP|Uncut diamond|15}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Binding necklace|25}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Cannonball|300}} +\n  4 * {{GEP|Runite ore|6}} +\n  3 * {{GEP|Onyx bolt tips|10}} +\n  2 * {{GEP|Jug of water|300}} +\n  2 * {{GEP|Runite bar|5}} +\n\n  3 * 2 * {{RDTValue}} <!-- rdt drops double quantity -->\n)\n}}}}\n\nThe average Abyssal Sire kill is worth {{Coins|floor({{GEP|Ashes}}+{{#var:ASunique}}+{{#var:ASconsumables}}+{{#var:ASregulartable}})}} coins.

They are difficult to hunt as they seem to have a high [[defence]], [[hitpoints]], and [[strength]], although they have low accuracy. It should also be noted that they are difficult to [[poison]], although they are not immune to it. Abyssal walkers killed in the Abyss yield much lower [[experience]]. These monsters are [[aggressive]], but will stop being aggressive after a while as well as the [[Abyssal guardian]] and the [[Abyssal leech]].\n\nIf hunting Abyssal monsters for their [[Runecraft]] [[pouch (Runecraft)|pouch]] drops, it is recommended to use magic against these.

After completion of the quest, they can be found in the western chamber of the [[Lithkren Vault]].\n\nTo get back to the laboratory underneath [[Lithkren]], players can travel using the rowboat from the quest or, after completion, taking a [[digsite pendant]] and using it on the strange machine north of the rune dragon room, adding a teleport straight to [[Lithkren]] on it.\n\nAdamant dragons are the result of a side project of [[Zorgoth]]'s after being inspired by another [[dragonkin]], {{RSL|Forcae}}, which involves infusing [[Dragon (race)|dragon]] eggs with various metals. While Forcae's metal dragons were created to find a solution to the dragonkin's infertility, Zorgoth had bred his metal dragons for his [[Dragonkin Conflicts|war against humanity]].\n\n==Attacks==\nAdamant dragons have multiple attacks, similar to [[Mithril dragon|mithril]] and [[rune dragon]]s. Along with standard [[dragonfire]] attacks, they have a standard [[melee]], [[ranged]] and [[magic]] attack (which resembles [[Earth Wave]]), as well as two unique attacks.\n\nThe first attack is a [[poison]] projectile, which lands on the player's position and splits into two more projectiles around the original projectile in a 5x5 area. These projectiles can hit from 14-25, but can be reduced to 4-8 by being under the effect of any poison protection. Players can avoid the attack entirely by moving three squares away from their original position when the attack was launched.\n\nThe second attack is a Ranged attack that hits through [[Protect from Missiles]], and uses the ''Blood Forfeit'' effect from [[ruby bolts (e)|enchanted ruby bolts]], where the dragon sacrifices 10% of its current hitpoints to deal damage equal to 20% of the player's current hitpoints. Because of this effect, it is recommended to keep the player's hitpoints around 40-50 to minimise the damage dealt from this attack.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite bar|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/110}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant arrow|Quantity=30-40|Rarity=8/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wrath rune|Quantity=10-30|Rarity=8/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=60-120|Rarity=7/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=30-60|Rarity=7/110}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{UsefulHerbDropTable|8/110}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{UsefulHerbDropTable2|8/110}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant javelin heads|Quantity=40-50|Rarity=8/110|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>If [[Monkey Madness II]] has not been completed, the drop rate of adamant javelin heads are 15/110.</ref>|AltRarity=15/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant bolts(unf)|Quantity=20-40|Rarity=11/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Diamond|Quantity=1-3 (noted)|Rarity=7/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon javelin heads|Quantity=20-30|Rarity=7/110|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Dragon javelin heads are only dropped after completion of [[Monkey Madness II]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite ore|Quantity=8-20 (noted)|Rarity=6/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite bar|Quantity=5-35 (noted)|Rarity=4/110}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bolts (unf)|Quantity=15-20|Rarity=1/110}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wrath talisman|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/110}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Rare drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|1/110|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|338}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/320|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon limbs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1000}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon metal slice|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/9000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/2250|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=23 May 2019|update=Hosidius Rework and Deadman Beta|change=Adamant dragons now play a sound effect when they launch their poison attack.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=26 July 2018|update=Revenant Cave Rewards and Troll Quest Announcement|change=The [[Slayer Task Tips|slayer tip]] given by [[slayer master]]s assigning adamant dragons has been updated.

Aside from this, Ahrim can also use [[Confuse]], [[Weaken]] and [[Curse]] on the player, lowering their [[Attack]], [[Strength]] and [[Defence]] stats respectively. Ahrim's set effect is '''Blighted Aura''', which gives him a 20% chance to lower the player's Strength stat by 5 for each [[successful hit]].\n\nIt is recommended that the player uses [[Protect from Magic]] when fighting him due to his accuracy - although note that it will '''not''' protect against his stat reductions. Even if using the Protect from Magic prayer, his stat reduction spells can still work, plus his set effect can still activate because the attack still counts as a successful hit, so the use of dragonhide armour and bringing a [[Stat restore potion]] is recommended.\n\nAhrim is commonly defeated with the use of a [[toxic blowpipe]], [[rune crossbow|rune]]/[[Karil's crossbow]] or [[crystal bow]].

The Alchemical Hydra was the creation of a [[Dragonkin]] named [[Karuulm]]. While Karuulm saw promise in his creation, he nevertheless saw it as a failure because he could not replicate its traits, and abandoned it along with his other creations: the [[Wyrm]]s, [[Drake]]s, and [[Hydra]]s.\n\nUnlike normal [[hydra]]s, the Alchemical Hydra can '''only''' be killed while on a hydra [[Slayer task]], which are only assigned by [[Konar]]. In addition, as it is only found within the volcano, players who have not completed the [[elite Kourend & Kebos Diary]] must wear [[boots of stone]], [[boots of brimstone]], or [[granite boots]] to protect themselves from the extreme heat of the dungeon floor.\n\nAlong with all the unique drops obtainable from hydras, it can also drop [[hydra leather]], which is used on the machinery south-west of the pool in the [[Lithkren Vault]] to create [[ferocious gloves]], as well as the [[hydra claw]], which is combined with a [[Zamorakian hasta]] to create the [[dragon hunter lance]].\n\n==The boss's lair==\nTo reach the boss, players must run north past the [[Tasakaal]], then east past the [[hydra]]s. They will then reach the entrance to the lair by [[Orrvor quo Maten]]. Alternatively, players with level 88 [[Agility]] can reach it safely by using the mysterious pipe just behind [[Kaal-Ket-Jor]], though this takes roughly the same time as reaching it by running past the hydras.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{main|Alchemical Hydra/Strategies}}\nAlchemical Hydra has four phases throughout the fight, depending on its remaining health. It attacks with [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]], alternating between them every three attacks for the first three phases. At the start of each phase, it has a 75% damage reduction, which can be removed if it is lured over a vent on the floor which spews chemical liquid. However, the vent must be the correct one, corresponding to the [[combat triangle]] (e.g. when it is green, red will weaken it), otherwise the Hydra's damage is increased by up to 50%.\n\nWhen the Alchemical Hydra reaches 75%, 50% or 25% of its health (that is, at 825, 550, and 275 [[Hitpoints]]), it will lose one of its heads and changes phase. The damage reduction is reapplied, and so it should be lured over the next vent. It also has special attacks for each phase: poison pools when green and black, electricity when blue and fire when red. These special attacks can be avoided, but they can be devastating if dealt with carelessly.\n\nWhen the Hydra is killed, it will respawn in approximately 25 seconds.\n\n==Drops==\n''In addition to the 100% drop, the player will also have two rolls on the Alchemical Hydra's drop table. The first drop has a chance to be a unique, while the second is always standard. The drop rates in the drop table below reflect the chance of getting an item for every roll on the standard loot table.

They are used by members to train combat as they have high hit points and they have low defence and attack, meaning that the player takes little to no damage and can afk train on them. This involves running to a location where 2 or more crabs are spawned which ensures you will never leave combat. \n\nAmmonite crabs will become unaggressive after 10 minutes of combat.

Each wizard uses a different attack style and can hit fairly high, requiring players to be prepared for a three-on-one fight.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe wizards are ''much'' stronger than their combat levels suggest, as most of their combat levels are due to their offensive stat levels. Together, they are comparable in damage output to a [[God Wars Dungeon]] main boss. The goal should be to kill them as quickly as possible. Especially if there are no obstacles to get two of three wizards stuck behind, super sets, bossing food such as [[shark]]s or [[tuna potato]]es, and food for [[Tick_manipulation|tick-eating]] such as [[karambwan]] and/or [[pineapple pizza]] are highly advisable.\n\nAncient Wizards have low [[Defence]], so [[melee]] or [[Ranged]] is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. It is worth noting the melee-using wizard has a significantly higher maximum hit than the rest of the wizards, so activating [[Protect from Melee]] is '''highly recommended''' while under attack by this wizard. Armour such as [[dragonhide armour]] is recommended.\n\nIf available, the player should make use of nearby obstacles to limit the number of wizards able to attack the player at once. '''The other wizards cannot be used to safespot the melee wizard''', he will simply walk through them. It is advised to kill the wizards in this order: Melee (if he cannot be safespotted), Ranged, and finally Magic, using the equivalent protection [[Prayer]] matching the style of the target wizard each time.\n\nAll three wizards will open combat with their special attacks, which hit hard and hit fast. However, their damage output decreases significantly after this first volley. Don't allow this warning to lead one into complacency.\n\nA form of [[antipoison]] is recommended as the melee-using wizard is capable of poisoning the player.\n\nFor Ancient Wizards fought in the [[Wilderness]], bring items you are prepared to lose.\n\n[[File:Zarosian ambush.png|thumb|left|350px|Ancient wizards ambush the player.]]\n{{clear|left}}\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=202394}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff of fire|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/50}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=5-24|Rarity=5/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=5-24|Rarity=5/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=5-24|Rarity=5/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bolts|Quantity=1-5|Rarity=5/50}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|5/50}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|5/50}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{AllotmentSeedDropTable|3/50}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{AllotmentSeedDropTable2|3/50}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=50-249|Rarity=10/50|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Prayer potion(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Pure essence|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=7/50}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite crossbow (u)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/50}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Looting bags are only dropped by those found in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Interestingly, the poison inflicted by the melee-using Ancient Wizard who uses a poisoned [[dragon dagger]] starts at 8, which is more than a dragon dagger (p++) available to players, which starts at 6.\n\n{{Treasure Trails}}\n[[Category:Old School-exclusive content]]\n[[Category:Zarosians]]",

He is first encountered by players in [[Ardougne]] at the end of the quest [[Regicide]], after which he can be interacted with in the building at the very east end of Lletya. Players must have started [[Mourning's End Part I]] to enter Lletya and encounter Arianwyn. Arianwyn is heavily featured in the quests Mourning's End Part I and [[Mourning's End Part II|Part II]].\n\nIn [[Song of the Elves]], Arianwyn rescues the player and [[Elena]] after being kidnapped by [[Lord Iorwerth]]. After learning [[Seren]]'s dark secret, he becomes dismayed and switches side to the [[Iorwerth]] clan. The player must then defeat him during the battle of [[Lletya]].

All [[mountain troll]]s are named after the first thing they ate or tried to eat. Arrg, however, makes an exception. With some trolls, the name of what they first ate is unknown. This is the case with Arrg, so he was named after the sound made by the first thing he ate. This is the same case with [[Ug]] and [[Aga]].\n\nArrg is the second strongest mountain [[troll]] in ''[[RuneScape]]'', now being surpassed by [[Kob]] from the [[Monkey Madness II]] quest. He uses [[melee]] and [[ranged]], both of which can hit up to 38, although the [[Fremennik round shield]] reduces the maximum damage from ranging to 20. Another way to kill him is to wear at least rune, have 6-8 doses of prayer potion pray protect from melee, and he will rarely hit you with his ranged and only around 4-8 monkfish are needed, if 70 or higher combat. He teleports the player to the [[Troll arena]] to fight. It is best to use a combination of [[protect from melee]] and [[protect from Missiles|ranged]] against him and switch prayers as he switches attacks. His attack speed is equivalent to that of a whip, so this can be tricky. Arrg can only be fought during the quest, and afterwards he can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n\n==Normal drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=60|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=45|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=25|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable|19/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable2|19/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coal|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw mackerel|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=35|Rarity=29/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=100|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=7/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=50|Rarity=6/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=250|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|5/128|naturetalisman=yes|chaostalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Normal}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Troll bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/4|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Troll bones are only dropped during [[Rag and Bone Man II]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled troll head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/45}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Nightmare Zone drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Hard}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Hard}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Unlike most trolls, Arrg drops regular [[bones]] instead of [[big bones]] outside of the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n\n{{Troll Romance}}\n{{Trolls}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Troll Stronghold (location)}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Like other creatures within the dungeon, they can be found fighting for their god [[Armadyl]], engaging in combat against the followers of [[Zamorak]].\n\nThe ability to be assigned aviansies can be purchased for 80 [[slayer reward point]]s. Once unlocked, they can be toggled off. Though, in order to toggle them back on, they must be purchased again for 80 slayer points or removed from the assignments list through the use of the cancellation slots.\n\nUnlike most other followers, however, aviansies have an increased sense of danger. Even if they are in combat with another monster, if the player attempts to attack them, the aviansie will start attacking the player immediately; this trait is shared by all Armadylian monsters.\n\nAs they are airborne, they are completely immune to [[melee]] attacks except for [[salamander]]s, and can only be damaged with either [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. If the player attempts to attack an aviansie with a [[melee weapon]], the message ''The Aviansie is flying too high for you to attack using melee.'' will appear in their chatbox, and the aviansie will become [[aggressive]] and start attacking the player if it hasn't already.\n\n[[Adamant bar]] drops from aviansies in the God Wars Dungeon will be noted for players that have completed the [[Fremennik Diary#Hard|Hard Fremennik Diary]]. They also do not drop [[looting bag]]s, unlike all other monsters in the [[Wilderness]].\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=70302}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Aviansie}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Feather|Quantity=1-6|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dagger(p+)|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=18/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=9|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Body rune|Quantity=12|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=11|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mind rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=16|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite bar|Quantity=4|Rarity=30/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Aviansies in the God Wars Dungeon drop unnoted bars until completion of the [[Fremennik Diary#Hard|Hard Fremennik Diary]], while those in the Wilderness God Wars Dungeon always drop noted bars regardless of diary completion.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Silver ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite limbs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Antipoison(3)|Quantity=5|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Swordfish|Quantity=5|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|3/128|chaostalisman=yes|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled aviansie head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/35|AltRarity=1/20|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Aviansies in the [[God Wars Dungeon]] drop the ensouled head at a rate of 1/35, while those in the [[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon]] drop it at a rate of 1/20.</ref>{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Kieren|url=https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/689153404288004097|date=18 January 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gl8ED|archivedate=25 March 2019|quote=Fair few people asking about ensouled head drop rates...

There is an [[agility shortcut]] that allows direct access to them, requiring level 87 in [[Agility]].\u00a0Unlike their adult forms, they do not [[dragonfire|breathe fire]].\n\nBaby green dragons may be killed by players who have received green dragons as a [[slayer]] assignment but do not wish to kill adult green dragons in the [[Wilderness]] or their [[Brutal green dragon|brutal counterparts]] in the [[Ancient Cavern]]. Killing a baby green dragon will not suffice for surpassing the Elite clue scroll, which tasks the player with killing a green dragon.\n\nThere is a [[safespot]] in the north-west corner of the plateau.\n\nTo reach baby green dragons, enter Brimhaven Dungeon (remember to bring 875 gold to enter and an [[axe]] to chop vines), go down the stairs west, and chop down the vines. Turn right and go immediately north and chop down the vines (requiring 34 [[Woodcutting]] to chop the vines). If you have at least 87 Agility, then run northwest until you reach a bright green vine, bringing you directly to baby green dragons. If you do not have 87 Agility, you may instead continue to run west into a room with a ring-shaped pond of lava. Go up the staircase in the north of this room. On the upper level, run south past the fire giants, then turn east at the first fork in this path to find the baby green dragon area.\n[[File:Baby dragon (green) safespot.png|thumb|left|220px|The safespot.]]\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Brimhaven Dungeon]] (upper level)\n*[[Corsair Cove Dungeon]] (in the [[Myths' Guild]] section, one spawn)\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Babydragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=29 January 2020|update=Poll 69, BH Rewards, and Welcome Screen|poll=|change=The NPC name was changed from \"Baby dragon\" to \"Baby green dragon\" to accommodate colourblind players.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Dragon}}\n{{Brimhaven Dungeon}}\n{{Corsair Cove Dungeon}}",

They are descendants of the followers of [[Zaros]] who were persecuted by the followers of [[Saradomin]] and [[Zamorak]], and bear a grudge toward their followers for this reason. They can be pickpocketed at level 53 [[Thieving]], yielding [[coins]], [[antipoison]], or [[lockpicks]].\n\nDue to the grudge they hold, if a player wears a Saradomin/Zamorakian item and approaches a bandit, they will shout \"''Time to die, Saradominist filth!''\"/\"''Prepare to suffer, Zamorakian scum!''\" and become [[aggressive]] toward the player. In addition, if a player attacks other bandits, the bandits will exclaim \"''You chose the wrong place to start trouble!''\" and become aggressive towards the player.\n\nSome players use this mechanic as a way to passively train their [[Combat]] skills. Players will wear a [[God]]-affiliated item, equip strong melee gear, and wait as the bandits attack them. This allows players to passively gain large amounts of Combat [[experience]], as the bandits will never stop attacking the player. AFK experience rates from bandits range from 30k to 70k xp per hour depending on levels.

good for lower level training because they have poor Defence and there are many obstacles in the Barbarian Village to trap them behind. If the player chooses to talk to them, they will taunt the player with quotes such as \"Wanna fight?\" or \"You come to fight, ja?\" and immediately attack; players can avoid this by immediately exiting the dialogue instead of clicking to continue.\n\nThe barbarians within the [[Ancient Cavern]] are level 132. The ones at Barbarian Village are combat level 10, but the ones inside the hall are level 17 (except [[Gunthor the brave]], who is the strongest barbarian in the village at level

It has two attack styles. If in melee range, it attacks with its anchor and deactivates all prayers and drains prayer points. If the player is outside of melee range, it performs an attack in which it slams its anchor to the ground, triggering an earthquake that can inflict up to 25 damage. However, it will not use its ranged attack if the player is standing behind something (AKA [[safespotting]]).\n\n[[Protect from melee]] is highly advised, but due to Barrelchest's attacks deactivating and draining prayers, it is recommended to use quick-prayers to reactivate prayers swiftly. Upon defeat, Barrelchest will drop the [[barrelchest anchor]], but it requires repairs before it can be equipped.\n\nDue to its high offensive melee stats, it is recommended to wear armour that provides high melee defence, preferably against crushing attacks. Barrelchest also drains your defence. Lower level players are advised to use a [[super defence potion]], have a [[prayer potion]] on standby, and high healing foods. Fast melee weapons such as the [[dragon dagger]]'s special attack and the [[abyssal whip]] are effective.\n\nBarrelchest can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{The Great Brain Robbery}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Players require a [[Defence]] level of 20 in order to receive basilisks as a [[Slayer task]], as this is required to wield the shield. Basilisks have below average accuracy for their level, but have high Defence.\u00a0\n\nWithout the mirror shield, the player's combat stats will be greatly reduced with each hit. The [[Protect from Melee]] prayer can be used,\u00a0but the stats will still be lowered.\n\nBasilisks are a good source of [[runes]]. Due to their high drop rate of [[nature rune]]s, it would be useful to bring a [[Staff of fire]] or kill some [[pyrefiends]] to the east, to use [[High Level Alchemy]] on their frequent metal armour and weapon drops.\n\nThese can be [[safespot]]ted from the southern entrance to their area in the [[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]], by using the south-east wall to stop their movement. This does not remove the need of a mirror shield, as their drain attack is ranged. Other safespots can be achieved by using the rocks on either side of the room, having the Basilisk get stuck on the other side of the rocks/pebble.

However, for people with higher magic and [[defence]] (80+ and 70+ respectively recommended), it might be more economical to use [[food]]. Their [[aggressiveness]] depends on the type of [[God capes|god cape]] a player wears; mages are not aggressive to players wearing their God's cape.\n\nAdditionally, wielding a [[Void knight mace]] whilst wearing a non-Guthix cape such as the Saradomin cape or Zamorak cape will cause only one type of Battle mage to be aggressive towards players at any one time.

Although they drop [[black dragonhide]], [[Lava dragon]]s '''do not''' count towards a black dragon task.\n\nOne is fought during Dragon Slayer II.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Taverley Dungeon]]\n**[[Taverley Dungeon#Upper level|Taverley Dungeon upper level]] ([[Slayer task]] only)\n*[[Evil Chicken's Lair]] - requires starting the [[Recipe for Disaster#Sir Amik Varze|Sir Amik Varze subquest]] of [[Recipe for Disaster]]\n*[[Corsair Cove Dungeon]] ([[Myths' Guild]] basement) - requires completion of [[Dragon Slayer II]]\n*[[Wilderness]]:\n**[[Revenant Caves]]\u00a0(level 247)\n**[[Lava Maze Dungeon]]\n*[[Mynydd]]\n\n==Location comparisons==\nIn Taverley Dungeon, black dragons are found in the western wing of the dungeon. There are two spots; a common and slayer area. The common area only contains two black dragons(safe-spottable behind the ladder), while the slayer area has twelve black dragons. The black dragons in the slayer only area can only be killed when assigned black dragons; players will be stopped by [[Slieve]] if they attempt to attack them off-task. The common area requires a [[dusty key]] or 70 [[Agility]] (boostable) to reach the dragons, while the slayer area can be accessed by steps near the entrance.\n\nThe Evil Chicken's Lair has four black dragons, the most out of any common area. Black dragons here require starting Sir Amik Varze's subquest in Recipe for Disaster, and until the [[dragon token]] is redeemed, they will only drop it and their 100% drops. Accessing this area requires a [[raw chicken]] offered to the chicken shrine in [[Zanaris]].\n\nTwo dragons may be found in the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]. Accessing this area requires completion of [[Dragon Slayer II]], but it is the closest location to a bank.\n\nBlack dragons may also be found in the Wilderness in two locations; the Lava Maze Dungeon and Revenant Caves. There are two dragons in the Lava Maze Dungeon, and accessing them requires a lengthy trek through the Lava Maze, requiring a sharp weapon to cut webs. Some antipoison may be needed due to the presence of poison spiders near the dragons. There are also three dragons in the Revenant Caves; these dragons are slightly stronger to those found in the other locations mentioned above, and are the only ones that reside in a [[Multicombat area]]. These dragons are avoided due to being next to [[revenant]]s, a high traffic area and with little means to escape if attacked by other players. Players are not recommended to kill black dragons in the Wilderness unless part of a Wilderness slayer assignment, as doing so runs the risk of being killed by other players.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Black dragon (Taverley Dungeon, upper level) safespot.png|Safespots found in the middle of the [[Taverley Dungeon]]'s upper area.\nFile:Black dragon (Lava Maze Dungeon) safespot.png|A safespot in the [[Lava Maze Dungeon]].\nFile:Evil lair dragon safespot.png|Safespot location in the [[Evil Chicken's Lair]]. \n</gallery>\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value|Black dragon#Level 227|mobname=black dragon}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Dragon bones are dropped in [[bank note]] form if players have completed the [[Wilderness Diary]] and are killing black dragons in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black dragonhide|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon token|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The dragon token overrides normal drops, and is only dropped during the [[Recipe for Disaster#Sir Amik Varze|Sir Amik Varze subquest]] of [[Recipe for Disaster]] if the player doesn't have one already.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune knife|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant javelin|Quantity=30|Rarity=20/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant dart(p)|Quantity=16|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=50|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=75|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=196|Rarity=40/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=330|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=690|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead|Version=Level 227}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon javelin heads|Quantity=10|Rarity=6/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Dragon javelin heads are only dropped after completion of [[Monkey Madness II]].

Being a [[slayer monster]], bloodvelds require a [[Slayer]] level of 50 to be damaged by players. Despite being a [[demon]], it is not affected by [[demonbane weapons]].\n\n==Strategy==\nBloodvelds are one of few monsters that attack with [[Magical melee|magic-based melee]], meaning that despite it using [[melee]] attacks against the player, it is the player's [[magic defence]] (rather than their melee [[defence]]) that is used to determine the accuracy of the bloodveld's attack. As such, it is recommended for players killing bloodvelds to equip armour with decent magic defence, such as [[dragonhide]], as they are relatively accurate in combat. Players using [[prayer]] should still [[pray melee]] instead of magic to nullify damage.\n\nThey can be [[safespotted]] on the northeastern corner of the centre room of the [[Slayer Tower]] behind the chair, or they can also be safespotted next to the armour stands and wardrobes around the walls of the central room. In the task-only basement floor, they can be safespotted in the north-west corner of the area by standing in between the chest, chair, broken table and shelves. Bringing [[Nature rune|nature runes]] for [[alchemy spells]] is a good idea, as they frequently drop [[Fire rune|fire runes]] and items with a decent high alchemy value.\n\nThey can also be safespotted in the [[Stronghold Slayer Cave]] while using a [[Dwarf multicannon]] in the north-east section of the bloodveld area, but this area is usually busy. \n\nAnother safespot in the Stronghold Slayer Cave is in the east room, north of some rocks and east of a pillar.\n\nIn the [[God Wars Dungeon]], they can be safespotted behind the piles of bricks directly north-east of the exit rope. Both a [[Saradomin item]] and [[Zamorak item]] are required to use this safespot. Another safespot will be even further north-east, behind the rock formations on the coast.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Slayer Tower]], {{FloorNumber|2}} and basement.\n*[[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]\n*[[God

Like all dragons, they can breathe [[dragonfire]], which can inflict up to 50 damage if proper protections aren't used. Dragonfire can be mitigated by equipping an [[anti-dragon shield]] or a [[dragonfire shield]] \u2013 alongside the usage of an [[antifire potion]], which will completely negate dragonfire damage. On top of the strong dragonfire breath, they also attack with an accurate slash attack.\n\nTwo are fought during Dragon Slayer II.\n\n==Protections from dragonfire==\nThe following methods will provide partial protection:\n*'''An [[anti-dragon shield]] or a [[dragonfire shield]] (''permanent''):''' offers high protection, significantly reducing dragonfire damage.\n*'''An [[antifire potion]] (''temporary''):''' offers partial protection, resulting in damage reduction generally with resistance similar to the shield mentioned above. Occasionally, you may be 'horribly burnt by the dragon fire', receiving moderate damage.\nThe following methods will provide '''100% protection''', but each has its own pros and cons:\n*'''An antifire potion + an anti-dragon or a dragonfire shield:''' temporary but saves a large amount of [[food]] considering how long each potion lasts. This method is strongly recommended as you can use prayer flicking to [[Protect from Melee]], ultimately negating 100% of damage.\n*'''An antifire potion or anti-dragon/dragonfire shield + [[Protect from Magic]]:''' not advised due to the high cost of [[prayer potion]]s, this is only recommended for players with a high [[Prayer]] level. Alternatively, prayer flicking is an option. This leaves players vulnerable to melee attacks, however.\n*'''A [[super antifire potion]]:''' More expensive than antifire potions, but they fully protect from dragonfire, allowing the use of a better shield or defender.\n\n==Safespotting==\nAlternate methods to avoid usage of potions includes the [[Heroes' Guild]], which has a blue dragon in a fenced off area that can be safespotted. If one has partially completed [[Watchtower]], there are [[safespot]]s in the [[Ogre Enclave]] with six dragons that spawn.

They call out \"Rest in cabbage!\" upon appearing.\n\n==Strategy==\nBrassican Mages have low [[Defence]], so melee or Ranged is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. Because a player cannot pray against a Brassican Mage's attack, having plenty of [[food]] before the fight is essential, especially considering that the strange device damages the player after every use. It is recommended to use a weapon with a strong special attack, such as a [[Dragon dagger]].\n\nAlthough protection prayers do not work against them, it can be useful to use defensive prayers such as [[Steel Skin]] to increase your overall defence. It is even more useful to use [[Piety]] or [[Rigour]] (depending on combat style) to increase both your defence and your melee/range stats.\n\nWearing [[rings of recoil]] or a charged [[ring of suffering]] is useful in deflecting some damage back onto the Mage. Also, setting up a [[dwarf multicannon|cannon]] is highly helpful.\n\nFor Brassican Mages fought in the [[Wilderness]], bring a [[clue box]] and items you are prepared to lose.

They are notable for being the only monsters to drop the [[Brine sabre]]. A [[Slayer]] level of 47 is required to fight them, and a [[spade]] is required to access the cavern.\n\nThey are only [[Slayer task|assigned]] to players who have progressed in [[Olaf's Quest]] to the point where they need to enter the Brine Rat Cavern. Alternatively, they can be killed as an alternative for a [[rat]] [[Slayer task]] provided the player has the appropriate Slayer level to do so.\n\nBrine rats have relatively low [[Defence]], but fairly high [[Strength]] and [[Attack]]. As such, it is recommended to bring [[food]] if players do not have high (~70) Defence.\n\nAlternatively, players can bring [[Bones to peaches (tablet)]] to convert their bones drops to peaches, which heal 8 hitpoints each.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Brine Rat Cavern]]\n**The [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DKS}} will take you close to the dungeon.\n\n==Tips==\n*Brine rats frequently drop [[raw swordfish]] and [[raw shark]]s in addition to [[raw rat meat]], so bringing a [[tinderbox]] and a couple of [[logs]] may be advisable. Alternatively, [[Olaf]], outside the caverns, has a permanent [[fire]] located beside him, so players can collect the unnoted raw fish/rat meat drops and cook them on his fire if they are willing to exit and re-enter the caverns multiple times.\n*There is one safespot in the north west corner of the cave. If the brine rats are in the top half of the cave, you are able to safespot them from behind the bones in the corner.\n*Although they look like [[safespot]]s, the bones and skeletons in the area do not work as such.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=128958}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw rat meat|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brine sabre|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes={{CiteForum|author=Envision|url=https://archive.fo/5P5mn|title=Drop Rates V2|name=Drop Rates V2}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=18/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=36|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw lobster|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw shark|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw rat meat|Quantity=18 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw pike|Quantity=18 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw shark|Quantity=8 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw swordfish|Quantity=9|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw shark|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1|Rarity=21/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=2|Rarity=16/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=4|Rarity=9/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=29|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=16/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water talisman|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (medium)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1068171049441865734|date=28 November 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/lPakz|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=1/128.

They can be found while cutting [[light jungle|light]], [[medium jungle|medium]] or [[dense jungle]] bushes. They use [[Magic]] attacks which can drain a player's combat stats. They are highly resistant to conventional attack methods, but certain consumables can be used on them to damage them:\n*The green victims can be damaged with any type of [[antipoison]] potion that is '''not''' a [[Barbarian Potions|barbarian mix]]. They will only take one dose at a time. If the player has completed the [[Druidic Ritual]] [[quest]], twice the damage dealt to these victims with antipoison is received as [[Herblore]] experience.\n*The yellow victims can be damaged with [[Relicym's balm]]. They will only take one dose at a time. If the player has completed the [[Druidic Ritual]] [[quest]], twice the damage dealt to these victims with Relicym's balm is received as [[Herblore]] experience.\n*The white victims can be damaged with food. This includes cooked food and other food items such as [[banana]]s that players can normally eat to heal. Drink items that can heal players such as [[beer]] will '''not''' work. [[Calquat fruit]] also works. Twice the damage dealt to these victims with food is received as [[Cooking]] experience.\n\nWhen using the correct consumable on the victim, they will suffer high (up to around 30) damage. If you just get the message \"Nothing interesting happens,\" check that you are using the correct consumable.\n\nIf a player wishes to fight Broodoo victims without using items, a fast weapon such as a [[scimitar]] is best due to the low damage they take, and they can be inflicted with [[poison]] or [[venom]] to add more damage over time.

Bryophyta's lair is located just north of where the moss giants reside in the sewers, accessible by the [[agility shortcut]] from the [[Edgeville Dungeon]] (51 [[Agility]] required) or through the Varrock Sewers.\n\nIn order to access Bryophyta's lair, the player must obtain a [[mossy key]] from a [[moss giant]]. Each mossy key permits for only one attempt, similar to accessing [[Obor]]'s lair with a [[giant key]].\n\nBryophyta is the boss that drops [[Bryophyta's essence]], which is used to make [[Bryophyta's staff]]. This item can store [[nature rune]]s, and has a chance to not consume them when casting a spell that uses them. It cannot be obtained in any other way besides trading with players.\n\n==Strategy==\nIn order to reach Bryophyta, players will need a [[knife]] or [[Slash weapons|slash weapon]] to slash the web to get to the lair if they are reaching her via the [[Varrock Sewers]]. Members with level 51 [[Agility]] do not need this as they can access an agility [[shortcut]] by [[Vannaka]] in the [[Edgeville Dungeon]].\n\nUnlike Obor's chambers (where he is confined in a small pit), players are immediately taken to Bryophyta's chambers, where she will attack them on sight - prior to entering the room, activate [[Protect from Magic]].\n\n[[File:Fighting Bryophyta.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fighting Bryophyta.]]\n\nShe is also capable of [[poison]]ing players, starting at 8 damage, so it is recommended to bring some form of poison protection to cure her poison. Unlike [[Obor]], she does not take protection prayers into account.\n\nDuring the fight, she may summon three [[growthling]]s - they are fairly weak, but they must be killed, as Bryophyta is immune to all damage (except poison and venom) while they are alive. In order to finish them, an axe or secateurs must be '''used''' (not wielded) on them once they have been reduced to 1 hitpoint through standard combat. Players can grab a [[bronze axe]] from the pile of logs if they didn't bring one. She can only have one batch of growthlings in the chambers at a time, but can summon more if the previous batch were killed off.\n\nF2P players are recommended to bring [[green d'hide armour]] for the increased magic defence, as well as a [[rune kiteshield]] and [[rune full helm]] for the most optimal setup against her attacks. Regarding offence the player is best off with a [[rune scimitar]]. The recommended stats for fighting Bryophyta is a minimum of 50 in strength, attack and defence. Ranging Bryophyta is the most optimal for mid level F2P players with at least 60 ranged, 40 defence and 37 prayer. Players should wear [[green d'hide armour]], a [[coif]], an [[amulet of power]], and a [[maple shortbow]] with some [[adamant arrows]]. While ranging Bryophyta, ensuring a safe distance is optimal, which is easy as she will not move towards you. She will not use her melee attacks if a player is out of her reach and she will do little damage if protect from magic is being used. Magic is only viable for members, since they can wear [[Void Knight equipment|void knight]] or [[Elite Void Knight equipment|elite void knight]] equipment with the [[void mage helm]].\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Bryophyta}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (beginner)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune sword|Quantity=2|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=2|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant kiteshield|Quantity=3|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platebody|Quantity=5 (noted)|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Battlestaff|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=3|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=100|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=100|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=100|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=100|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=100,200|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=100|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant arrow|Quantity=100|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy guam leaf|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy marrentill|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy harralander|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy ranarr weed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy cadantine|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy tarromin|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Avantoe seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon|Namenotes={{(m)}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Watermelon seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Snape grass seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Jangerberry seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Snapdragon seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Belladonna seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cadantine seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tarromin seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wildblood seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Rare}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Harralander seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Unknown}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ranarr seed|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Unknown}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel bar|Quantity=25|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bar|Quantity=2|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=5 (noted)|Rarity=Uncommon|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=gem>Uncut rubies and uncut diamonds are always dropped together.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut diamond|Quantity=5 (noted)|Rarity=Uncommon|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=gem />}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8000-10000|Rarity=Common|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mossy key|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/16|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Kira|url=https://twitter.com/JagexKira/status/1005037658404507648|date=8 June 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/CwDWB|archivedate=25 March 2019|quote=#Bryophyta and Mossy Key rates are as follows: Mossy Key from: a Moss Giant 1/150 Mossy Key from: a Moss Giant on task 1/75 Mossy Key from: Bryophyta 1/16 Bryophyta's Essence: 1/118 (same as Obor's Club) And there you have it!

He is also able to perform a deadly shockwave attack that can hit up to 60 and may combine this with a melee attack, which is capable of instantly killing the player if they are within melee range and do not have [[Protect from Melee]] active.\n\nCallisto is immune to [[Magic]] damage, although [[spells]] with effects such as [[Vulnerability]] will still affect him.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{Main|Callisto/Strategies}}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tyrannical ring|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=12/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=.75/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=.5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=200|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=400|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=300|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=250|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cannonball|Quantity=250|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=7/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=gem>20 uncut [[rubies]] are dropped along 10 uncut [[diamond]]s.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut diamond|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=7/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=gem />}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mahogany logs|Quantity=400 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Magic logs|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Red dragonhide|Quantity=75 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coconut|Quantity=60 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut dragonstone|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy toadflax|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ranarr seed|Quantity=5|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Snapdragon seed|Quantity=3|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Magic seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Palm tree seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Yew seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=15000-19999|Rarity=19/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark crab|Quantity=8|Rarity=10/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=rest>8 [[dark crab]]s are dropped along with 3 [[Super restore (4)]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super restore(4)|Quantity=3|Rarity=10/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=rest />}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Supercompost|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=4.75/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=30 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark fishing bait|Quantity=375|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|470}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped while on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/100|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The elite clue scroll drop rate increases to 1/50 if a [[ring of wealth (i)]] is worn.</ref>|AltRarity=1/50|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Callisto cub|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/2000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Wilderness Slayer tertiary===\n{{WildernessSlayerDropTable|combat=470|hitpoints=255|boss=yes}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(4) is a tertiary drop only found in the seasonal mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(1)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(1) is a tertiary drop only found in the tournament mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=22 November 2018|update=Bird Nest Balancing and PvP Changes|change=Callisto's 75 noted [[crushed nest]]s drop was removed from its drop table, being replaced with 30 noted [[dragon bones]].}}\n{{Subject changes|date=8 February 2018|update=PvM QoL updates & Wilderness Rejuvenation improvements|poll=Quality of Life -

They can inflict poison, so it is advised that players bring [[antipoison]] potions when fighting them. They are the only enemy to drop [[bronze boots]]. They also drop a variety of [[Herblore]] ingredients, which can be helpful for lower level players looking for an alternative source of herbs over more popular sources, such as [[Chaos druids]].\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]]\n*[[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]\n*[[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon]]\n\n==Information==\nPlayers with very low [[Defence]] should use [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] to attack these monsters in order to avoid being damaged and possibly poisoned, utilising the rocks around the room's walls in [[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]] as safespots. When fighting cave crawlers in the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]], be aware that any exposed [[light sources]] (i.e [[candle]]s) may explode, and can cause a considerable amount of damage. As such, a [[bullseye lantern]] or an [[oil lantern]] is recommended as it is not an exposed light source. You can use the [[fairy ring]] just outside as a fast means of banking.\n\nAs mentioned above, players are advised to bring [[antipoison]] potions as cave crawlers have a chance to poison you when they hit. They also drop the ingredients to make them yourself. '''Note that it is recommended to use [[antidote++]] as it is cheapest antipoison available, and it lasts for 12 minutes for each dose. '''\n\nMuch like [[banshees]], cave crawlers regenerate their health back quickly, gaining back 1 hitpoint after every attack.\n\n==Potions==\nAssuming the player has the required Herblore levels, the various drops from Cave Crawlers can also be used to easily make the following potions.\n\nMaking these potions or even collecting the herbs dropped can be beneficial for those doing long Cave Crawler slayer tasks and/or earn some extra money whilst completing them. In addition, as the Cave Crawler can deal poison damage, making Antipoison potions with the items dropped can be extremely helpful.\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-1 align-center-2 align-center-4 align-center-6\"\n!{{SCP|Herblore}} Level\n! colspan=\"2\" |Potion\n! colspan=\"2\" |Herb\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ingredient\n|-\n|3\n|{{plinkt|Attack potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Guam leaf}}\n|{{plinkt|Eye of newt}}\n|-\n|5\n|{{plinkt|Antipoison}}\n|{{plinkt|Marrentill}}\n|{{plinkt|Unicorn horn dust}}\n|-\n|12\n|{{plinkt|Strength potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Tarromin}}\n|{{plinkt|Limpwurt root}}\n|-\n|22\n|{{plinkt|Restore potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Harralander}}\n|{{plinkt|Red spiders' eggs}}\n|-\n|30\n|{{plinkt|Defence potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Ranarr weed}}\n|{{plinkt|White berries}}\n|-\n|38\n|{{plinkt|Prayer potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Ranarr weed}}\n|{{plinkt|Snape grass}}\n|-\n|45\n|{{plinkt|Super attack}}\n|{{plinkt|Irit leaf}}\n|{{plinkt|Eye of newt}}\n|-\n|48\n|{{plinkt|Superantipoison}}\n|{{plinkt|Irit leaf}}\n|{{plinkt|Unicorn horn dust}}\n|-\n|50\n|{{plinkt|Fishing potion}}\n|{{plinkt|Avantoe}}\n|{{plinkt|Snape grass}}\n|-\n|55\n|{{plinkt|Super strength}}\n|{{plinkt|Kwuarm}}\n|{{plinkt|Limpwurt root}}\n|-\n|66\n|{{plinkt|Super defence}}\n|{{plinkt|Cadantine}}\n|{{plinkt|White berries}}\n|}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=80500}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Cave crawler}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=3-4|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=12|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=9|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{AllotmentSeedDropTable|26/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{AllotmentSeedDropTable2|26/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|22/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|22/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Vial of water|Quantity=1|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=White berries|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Unicorn horn dust|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Eye of newt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Red spiders' eggs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Snape grass|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=3|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=29|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=29/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|chaostalisman=yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCave crawler (1).png|A variant of cave crawler\nCave crawler (2).png|A variant of cave crawler\nCave crawler (3).png|A variant of cave crawler\nCave crawler (4).png|A variant of cave crawler\n</gallery>\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n{{Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon}}\n{{Fremennik Slayer Dungeon}}\n{{Lumbridge Swamp Caves}}",

Killing them requires the completion of [[Cabin Fever]], level 58 [[Slayer]], a [[witchwood icon]], and a [[light source]] (unless a [[Fire pit#Fire of Eternal Light|Fire of Eternal Light]] is lit). They are most often killed for their [[black mask]] drops along with a decent rate of [[Clue scroll (hard)|hard clue scrolls]].\n\nThe cave horrors have a special attack which always deals damage equal to 10% of the player's base Hitpoints level, rounded down (e.g. 9 damage at 96). This attack can be completely nullified by either wearing a [[witchwood icon]] '''OR''' by having [[Protect from Melee]] activated. Using protection prayers allows players to use more powerful necklaces instead of the witchwood icon as it only provides minor bonuses.\nAnother strategy is to use [[safespot]]s, but players should take caution leaving their safespot to loot, as the aggressive cave horrors may attack you. For this reason, if you do not have access to Protect from Melee, it is still recommended to bring the witchwood icon.\n\n==Location==\nCave horrors are found inside [[Mos Le'Harmless Cave]], located in the middle of the island next to the bay leading to the [[Trouble Brewing]] minigame. To get there, players may do any of the following:\n*Use the free [[minigame teleport]] to [[Trouble Brewing]] in the minigame tab.\n*Drink a [[Rum (Trouble Brewing)|Mos Le Harmless 'rum']] bought from [[Honest Jimmy]] for 20 [[pieces of eight]].\n*Use the\u00a0[[ectophial]]\u00a0to travel to\u00a0[[Port Phasmatys]]\u00a0and then talk to\u00a0[[Bill Teach]]\u00a0to sail there.\n*Use the\u00a0[[charter ship]] to sail there.\n*Teleport there using a [[Mos le'harmless teleport]] scroll, and then walk to the cave.\n*[[Harmony Island Teleport]] (requires [[Arceuus spellbook]], completion of [[Great Brain Robbery]]) and talk to [[Brother Tranquility]].\n\n==Strategy==\nWhen fighting cave horrors, players will need to either use [[Protect from Melee]] to negate all damage, or wear a [[witchwood icon]] and [[armour]] that provides high [[Magic]] [[Defence]] bonus (such as [[dragonhide armour]]) against their special and [[Magical melee|Magic-based Melee]] attacks.\u00a0Wearing a witchwood icon is necessary if not using Protect from Melee, as otherwise players will take heavy damage from the special attacks over time.\n\nCave horrors have fairly low [[Hitpoints]], and they are relatively spread apart, so it is generally best to use a fast-firing [[Ranged]] weapon like a [[toxic blowpipe]], [[magic shortbow (i)]] or [[Karil's crossbow]]. If using Melee, it is recommended to use equipment that provides high Prayer bonus (such as [[Proselyte armour]]) and always use Protect from Melee so a better amulet can be used. A [[dwarf multicannon]] can also be used to speed up kills. Cave horrors can alternatively be [[safespotted]] by using the mushrooms, stalagmites, and boulders inside the cave, such as the area by the swamp near the cave entrance.\n\n'''Note:''''' It is advisable to keep the witchwood icon in case of a close combat encounter if safespotting, or in case you run out of Prayer points.''\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=332479}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Cave horror}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black mask (10)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=6|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|13/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|13/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|18/128}} {{AllotmentSeedDropTable|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{RareSeedDropTable2|18/128}}\n{{AllotmentSeedDropTable2|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=44|Rarity=28/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=132|Rarity=12/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=440|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Teak logs|Quantity=4 (noted)|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mahogany logs|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|5/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled horror head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/30}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCave horror (1).png\nCave horror (2).png\nCave horror (3).png\nCave horror (4).png\nCave horror (5).png\n</gallery>\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=24 March 2016|poll=Old School Content Poll 40: Vanilla LootShare & QoL|update=White & Black Graceful|change=Increased the density of cave horror spawns.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n{{Mos Le'Harmless}}",

Cerberus requires a [[Slayer]] level of 91, along with a task of hellhounds or herself in order to be fought. In the event of a hellhound task, [[wild pie]]s may be used to boost the player's Slayer level.\n\nAs the Guardian of the River of Souls, Cerberus protects the souls of the departed from whatever troubles they may face on their journey by the people of [[Arceuus]]. Despite her important task, Cerberus longs to escape her post, and has successfully done so on multiple occasions; however, she was quickly captured and returned. Cerberus has killed many adventurers who have stumbled into her lair, with one of her more recent kills dropping a [[damaged soul bearer]] which the Arceuus Elders inspected and eventually discarded when they could not repair it.\n\nCerberus drops three different crystals; the [[eternal crystal|eternal]], [[pegasian crystal|pegasian]] and [[primordial crystal]]s which are used to upgrade [[infinity boots|infinity]], [[ranger boots|ranger]] and [[dragon boots]] to the [[eternal boots|eternal]], [[pegasian boots|pegasian]] and [[primordial boots]] respectively, the best-in-slot boots for their respective combat styles. She can also drop the [[smouldering stone]] at a much better rate compared to her lesser brethren, along with the [[jar of souls]] and the [[hellpuppy]] [[pet]].\n\nA [[dwarf multicannon]] cannot be set up inside Cerberus' Lair; if attempted, you will receive the message: ''You cannot place the cannon here, it would melt''.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Cerberus/Strategies}}\nWhen approaching her, Cerberus will become aggressive. She may attack with magic, ranged and melee attacks, each with a max hit of 23. The magic attack appears as a grey ball, the ranged attack appears as a ball of spikes, and the melee attack is her biting. Interestingly, she may use the melee attack at range.\n\nCerberus has three special attacks that she may use under certain circumstances:\n*She attacks in quick succession with magic followed by ranged and melee. She will do this at the start of every fight and approximately every 30 seconds afterwards.\n*She spits three balls of fire \u2014 indicated by her growling \u2014 on the ground, one at the player and two in random spots around the room. Standing on or near one will deal continuous damage. She will do this at random when below 200 health.\n*She summons three [[Summoned Soul|souls]] \u2014 indicated by her howling \u2014 that come from the river behind her and attack the player with each combat style. Each attack will drain 30 prayer (15 with [[spectral spirit shield]] equipped) if blocked or 30 hitpoints if not blocked. She may do this approximately every 30 seconds after she is below 400 health.\n\nIf a player has recently fought the boss, a line of fire will spawn between the entrance and the boss; stepping over this will deal 5 damage each way. The line of fire may be bugged, as it will not despawn unless the challenger dies to Cerberus or goes back through the line of fire after it respawns and if the challenger comes back after teleporting away mid-fight. Cerberus will restore all of its health if there are no players in its lair (it only has an examine option when this happens).\n\nOnce defeated, Cerberus will respawn in five seconds.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=93825}}\n\nThe average value of one kill is {{Coins|\n  0.25/128*1*{{GEP|Primordial crystal}} +\n  0.25/128*1*{{GEP|Pegasian crystal}} +\n  0.25/128*1*{{GEP|Eternal crystal}} +\n  0.25/128*1*{{GEP|Smouldering stone}} +\n  5/128*1*{{GEP|Rune platebody}} +\n  3/128*1*{{GEP|Black d'hide body}} +\n  3/128*1*{{GEP|Rune axe}} +\n  4/128*1*{{GEP|Rune chainbody}} +\n  4/128*1*{{GEP|Rune 2h sword}} +\n  3/128*1*{{GEP|Rune pickaxe}} +\n  3/128*6*{{GEP|Battlestaff}} +\n  3/128*1*{{GEP|Rune full helm}} +\n  2/128*1*{{GEP|Lava battlestaff}} +\n  2/128*1*{{GEP|Rune halberd}} +\n  3/128*300*{{GEP|Fire rune}} +\n  5/128*300*{{GEP|Pure essence}} +\n  5/128*100*{{GEP|Soul rune}} +\n  4/128*60*{{GEP|Blood rune}} +\n  4/128*40*{{GEP|Runite bolts (unf)}} +\n  4/128*50*{{GEP|Cannonball}} +\n  3/128*100*{{GEP|Death rune}} +\n  6/128*2*{{GEP|Super restore(4)}} +\n  4/128*6*{{GEP|Grimy torstol}} +\n  2/128*3*{{GEP|Torstol seed}} +\n  6/128*120*{{GEP|Coal}} +\n  3/128*5*{{GEP|Runite ore}} +\n  6/128*3*{{GEP|Summer pie}} +\n  5/128*15000 +\n  5/128*1*{{GEP|Unholy symbol}} +\n  5/128*20*{{GEP|Dragon bones}} +\n  5/128*15*{{GEP|Wine of zamorak}} +\n  4/128*50*{{GEP|Ashes}} +\n  4/128*20*{{GEP|Fire orb}} +\n  3/128*5*{{GEP|Uncut diamond}} +\n  3/128*1*{{RDTValue}} +\n  1/2000*1*{{GEP|Jar of souls}}\n}}, excluding the loot from clue scrolls.\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Unique===\n''There is a 1 in 128 chance of hitting the unique drop table.

This reflects the area around Cerberus as it guards the rivers that take souls to the Underworld and explains the [[jar of souls]] drop.\n**Although in its associated mythology Cerberus is male, the [[boss lair display]] refers to the boss in-game as female.\n*Cerberus stands on a trapdoor as a reference to the book/film ''{{wp|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}'' (or ''{{wp|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone}}''), in which a three-headed dog guarded a trapdoor. This also helps explain its four stone/crystal drops.\n*At one point, if a player had killed the last Cerberus of their task but also happened to die in the room, the player would be unable to recover their items as entering the boss chamber required the player to be on a [[hellhound]]s task. This was changed so that the player can enter the chamber, but is simply unable to attack the boss.\n**Along with this change, the summoned spirits it calls were also given weapons so that challengers could easily identify the [[combat style]] they would be using.\n*Upon release, the summoned souls would continue attacking the player even if Cerberus died. This is no longer the case with the [[16 March]] [[2017]] update.\n*Cerberus is the first [[Slayer boss]] whose attacks are fully protected by [[protection prayers]], the second being the [[Alchemical Hydra]].\n*When bones are used on Cerberus, a message appears saying \"Those aren't Cerby snacks\". This is a reference to \"Scooby Snacks\" from ''Scooby-Doo''.\n*About three weeks after the release of Cerberus, Mod Ronan did a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UWRPLChFMw stream] in which he killed Cerberus 1,000 times to show off the possible loot.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvZeJGNCb74DKcQEpJRzdzPBvSdNkE5zQy5pvOLbVWU/edit?usp=sharing Mod Ronan 1,000 Cerberus Kills]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cerberus}}\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n{{Demons}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Slayer monsters that can only be fought on task]]",

This area is moderately easy to access from the deep [[Wilderness teleport lever]] in [[Ardougne]] or [[Edgeville]]. A [[Wilderness Obelisk]] can randomly [[teleport]] players south-east of the Rogues' Castle.\n\nThe Chaos Elemental is generally killed for its [[dragon 2h sword]] and [[dragon pickaxe|pickaxe]] drops. It also has a higher drop rate of the [[pet chaos elemental]] compared to the [[Chaos Fanatic]]. In addition, it is immune to [[venom]]\u2014any items that are able to inflict venom will inflict regular [[poison]] instead.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''As this boss is located deep within the Wilderness, and wanders around in a multi-combat zone, beware of player-killers! Do not bring items you are not willing to lose.'''\n\nThe Chaos Elemental has a spawn timer of 60 seconds.\n\n==Attacks==\nThe Chaos Elemental's primary attack, a projectile attack, is a series of different colours fired at the target. This attack can deal either [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], or [[Melee]] damage \u2014 it is impossible to distinguish what damage is dealt. The projectiles hit into the 20s, but it is still suggested that players utilise [[Protect from Magic]] to reduce the chance of being hit, as the projectile deals magic damage most frequently.\n\n[[File:Chaos Elemental attacks.png|thumb|left|220px|Special attacks used by Chaos Elemental.]]\n[[File:Fighting Chaos Elemental.png|thumb|left|220px|A group of players take on the Chaos Elemental.]]\n\nIt also has two special attacks. The first one teleports players a short space or several spaces away from it. The second attack unequips up to four items that players are wielding, forcing them to take time to re-equip their [[armour]] and [[weapons]] before continuing the battle. Its attacks will continue to follow the player until impact and can travel through walls. The weapon of the player is always prioritised, so when this attack is successful, the player will always have to re-equip their weapon.\n\nHowever, if a player was to bring food such as [[curry]] to the Chaos Elemental, it will not be able to unequip the players items, because when you eat curry, the [[bowl]] will remain in the players inventory, giving the Chaos Elemental no room to remove your items. Another strategy to prevent this attack from being launched is to bring a sack (or basket) of potatoes, cabbages, onions, etc. Whenever you need to eat, simply empty the sack or basket after each bite. With practice this can be done quite quickly without interrupting your attacks.\n\nThis does, however, give the Chaos Elemental a chance to use a teleportation or offensive attack in turn, so you could leave just a single empty spot in your inventory for the Chaos Elemental to unequip one of your items instead of up to four. With enough practice this can save some supplies in the long run, since the unequipping attack does not deal any damage and replaces a potentially high-hitting offensive spell.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n\n===Minor drops===\n''These items are dropped with a [[Chaos Elemental#Major drops|major drop]]; for example, five [[tuna]] can be dropped with a [[dragon dagger]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Anchovy pizza|Quantity=3|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Babydragon bones|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bat bones|Quantity=5|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=3|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=4|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super attack(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super defence(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super strength(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tuna|Quantity=5|Rarity=1/10}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Major drops===\n''Major drops are accompanied by a minor drop on each kill.''\n\n====Pre-roll====\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/256}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n====Weapons and armour====\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n====Runes and ammunition====\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=500|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=75|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=250|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=125|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril dart|Quantity=300|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune arrow|Quantity=150|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n====Herbs====\n{{HerbDropTable|4/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|4/128|1-4}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n====Other====\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Strange fruit|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Antidote++(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Weapon poison(++)|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=7500|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n====Rare and Gem drop table====\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|8/128|3/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n====Tertiary====\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|305}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped while on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/200|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The elite clue scroll drop rate increases to 1/100 if a [[ring of wealth (i)]] is worn.</ref>|AltRarity=1/100|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Pet chaos elemental|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/300|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n====Wilderness Slayer tertiary====\n{{WildernessSlayerDropTable|combat=305|hitpoints=250|boss=yes}}\n\n====Deadman mode====\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(4) is a tertiary drop only found in the seasonal mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(1)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(1) is a tertiary drop only found in the tournament mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=1 August 2019|update=SOTE Changes and Small Game Updates|poll=Old School Content Poll 68: Small Game Improvements|change=The respawn time of the Chaos Elemental has been decreased from 150 seconds to 60 seconds.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=8 February 2018|update=PvM QoL updates & Wilderness Rejuvenation improvements|poll=Quality of Life - PvM Suggestions 2018|change=The Chaos elemental now uses its teleport attack less frequently than before.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=5 March 2015|update=Achievement Diaries|poll=Old School Achievement Diary Rewards Poll|change=The Chaos Elemental now drops [[dragon bone]]s and [[babydragon bones]] as notes if you have completed the [[Wilderness Elite Diary]].}}\n{{Subject changes|date=6 February 2014|update=Quick-prayers & Loot Broadcast|poll=Old School feature poll 15: Rejuvenating the Wilderness|change=The [[Kalphite Queen]], [[King Black Dragon]], the Chaos Elemental and the [[Dagannoth Kings]] now notify all nearby players of the loot they're dropping.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Wilderness}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Monsters that do not become tolerant]]",

They function similarly to their [[death spawn|normal variants]].\n\nRather than being summoned one at a time like normal death spawns, the Nechryarch summons 3 chaotic spawns immediately when it calls for them. The chaotic spawns also cover all three forms of the combat triangle; one uses melee, another uses magic, and the other one uses range.\n\nThese chaotic spawns are more accurate than their normal variants and have a higher max hit of 7. However unlike their normal variants, their attacks can be blocked with [[protection prayers]], though the best way to deal with the chaotic spawns in single-way areas is to run away until they lose interest, as they will not target the player again when they attack the Nechryarch. In multi-way areas, they can be killed with burst/barrage spells instead.\n\nOnce the Nechryarch dies, any chaotic death spawns they summoned will also despawn.\n\nDeath spawns are demons, so the special abilities of [[demonbane weapons]] affect them.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prior to an [[Update:Interface Improvement & More|update]] on [[30 March]] [[2017]], chaotic death spawn shared the same appearance as their normal counterpart.

Feathers are usually in high demand, therefore killing chickens and selling their feathers can be somewhat profitable for low level players.\n\nIn most populated [[Server|worlds]], chicken coops are often full of bones, feathers, and raw chicken left by players training on the chickens.

It is found in the [[Wilderness]] area of the [[Edgeville Dungeon]], by the [[Earth obelisk]]. Chronozon must be hit with all four elemental [[blast spells]] in order to be killed, or otherwise it will return to full health when it is nearly dead. Players should note that Chronozon has to be ''hit'' (i.e. do actual damage: if the spell splashes, it will not count). It will not drop the crest part unless the player has completed most of the quest. He can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Killing Chronozon==\nIt is recommended to bring any method of curing [[poison]] before encountering Chronozon, because players will have to pass an area filled with [[poison spider]]s that may attack you before you reach Chronozon. Chronozon is unique in that it has to be hit with each of the 4 elemental blast spells, [[Wind Blast]], [[Water Blast]], [[Earth Blast]] and [[Fire Blast]]. A message will appear in the chatbox, saying \"Chronozon weakens\" to confirm that the spell has been made effective.

In addition to its sigil drops, the Corporeal Beast has many other valuable drops.\n\nPlayers can pay 200,000 coins to open a group instance for their clan. \n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Corporeal Beast/Strategies}}\nThe lair of the Corporeal Beast is located in level 21 [[Wilderness]], although players can teleport directly there using a [[games necklace]]. This will take the player to a small safe room with a large doorway to Corporeal Beast.\n\n[[Ironmen]] with a [[combat level]] of 90 or higher have a separated Corporeal Beast room. All other accounts use the normal room. This is to reduce [[griefing]] and ironmen using normal accounts to use stat-reducing [[special attack]]s.\n\n[[File:Fighting Corporeal Beast.png|thumb|right|300px|A group of players fighting the Corporeal Beast.]]\nThe Corporeal Beast has a 50% damage reduction against any weapon that is not a [[spear]] or [[halberd]] on stab attack style. [[Protect from Magic]] does not fully block its magic attacks; it only reduces the damage by 33.33%. It has very high accuracy, damage, and [[Defence]].\n\nWhile fighting the Corporeal Beast, there is a chance that the [[dark energy core]] will spawn.

The entrance to the lair was also 14 [[Wilderness]] levels deeper than the one in-game.\n**It could only be fought after completing the quest [[rsw:Summer's End|Summer's End]].\n**The original Corporeal Beast could drop a [[rsw:Divine sigil|divine sigil]], which could be used to create a [[rsw:Divine spirit shield|divine spirit shield]]. Its effect was a constant 30% damage reduction per attack received, where the damage blocked was instead taken away from prayer points. The divine sigil's addition to ''Old School RuneScape'' has been polled twice, on [[18 September]] [[2014]] and [[15 February]] [[2019]], failing to reach the 75% threshold of passing at 66.1% and 72.8% respectively.\n**The original Corporeal Beast could drop the [[regen bracelet]].\n**The original Corporeal Beast was fought slightly differently by players. It boasted a higher maximum hit with melee of 51 instead of 33, as well as being vulnerable to [[poison]]. However, it would very quickly remove its poison unlike other monsters vulnerable to poison.\n*[[Pet]]s cannot be brought into the Corporeal Beast's lair. Attempting to enter the cave while having one following the player will cause a message to appear in the chatbox, stating ''Your follower hides in fear and refuses to enter the cave.'' If the player attempts to drop their pet while inside, the chatbox will instead state ''Your follower hides in fear and won't come out.''\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[TzTok-Jad]]|title=[[Strongest monster|Strongest monster in ''RuneScape'']]|successor=[[Great Olm]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Corporeal Beast}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Monsters that do not become tolerant]]",

If the player stands on an orange tile they will continue to take high damage until they step off of the highlighted tiles.\n\nAs the fight progresses, the tile patterns become more challenging, and the tiles change from crimson to orange more quickly.\n\n===Attack style cycle===\nThe Hunllef changes its prayer and attack styles on predictable cycles. Every fourth attack performed by the Hunllef (excluding the stomp attack) will cause the Hunllef to change its standard attack style; it will perform an animation before switching attack styles.\n\n===Protection prayer cycle===\nEvery sixth off-prayer attack that the player performs on the Hunllef will trigger a protection prayer change. The Hunllef will use the protection prayer used on the sixth off-prayer hit. Players can use this cycle to ensure the Hunleff never prays against their strongest attack style.\n\n==Protection against his attacks==\nPlayers can use their [[protection prayers]] to reduce the damage from the Corrupted Hunllef's standard attacks. Wearing pieces of the crystal armour will further reduce the incoming damage.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Armour combination\n!Corrupted Hunllef's max hit <ref group=\"A\">While using the correct [[protection prayer]] against its ranged and magic attacks.</ref>\n!Damage from tornadoes\n|-\n|{{NA}}||No armour||16||''Unknown''\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Corrupted helm (basic)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted body (basic)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted legs (basic)}}||Full T1 armour||13||15-25\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Corrupted helm (attuned)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted body (attuned)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted legs (attuned)}}||Full T2 armour||10||''Unknown''\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Corrupted helm (perfected)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted body (perfected)}}{{plinkp|Corrupted legs (perfected)}}||Full T3 armour||''6''||''Unknown''\n|}\n\n{{Reflist|group=A}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=2 July 2020|update=Poll 71 and Death Feedback Changes|poll=Old School Content Poll 71: Gauntlet, Grotesques, CoX and more|change=The Corrupted Hunllef will now play an animation and sound effect right before it changes its attack style.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=1 August 2019|update=SOTE Changes and Small Game Updates|poll=|change=<nowiki/>\n*The Corrupted Hunllef will now use Ranged as its first attack style.\n*The Corrupted Hunllef will now deal more damage if not praying the correct protection prayer; however, damage when praying correctly has been reduced.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n{{The Gauntlet}}",

Yup, Drakan, he's the man.] I see. I would perhaps be more inclined to believe you if I could not smell the death blood of his brother Draynor upon you.}} lives in a coffin in the basement of [[Draynor Manor]]. He was part of [[Vampyre Houses#House Drakan|House Drakan]], being the younger brother of [[Lowerniel Drakan|Lowerniel]], [[Ranis Drakan|Ranis]] and [[Vanescula Drakan]].\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete. A stake is not necessary to kill him in the Nightmare Zone, as he will automatically die upon reaching 0 health.\n\nKilling Count Draynor does count towards vampyre slayer tasks.\n\n==History==\nOriginally raised alongside his siblings on the vampyre homeworld of [[Vampyrium]], much of Draynor's history remains unknown. According to Vanescula, he liked to give himself various titles, but was considered to be cowardly by his siblings. He was eventually exiled from [[Morytania]] by Lowerniel and ended up west of the River Salve with his servant [[Ruantun]], which caused them to be significantly weakened. \n\nHe is responsible for many deaths of avid adventurers and innocents who have fallen prey to his sharp fangs. Count Draynor is the target in the [[Vampyre Slayer]] quest which requires the player to kill him to save the people of [[Draynor Village]], who have been terrorised by Count Draynor for centuries. \n\n==Fighting==\nThe health recovery rate of Count Draynor is very high - about six times the rate of ordinary monsters. Due to his health regeneration, he provides greatly reduced Combat experience when fighting him. [[Garlic]] does not affect this health regen speed; rather when the Count is at full health it deals 10 damage, reduces his attack and strength by 10 levels, and reduces his defence by 40 levels.<ref>https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1221516088086867974</ref> The garlic effect happens specifically on auto-attack delay, so it will always happen when using melee combat but if using magic you must autocast spells with a staff to trigger the garlic effect and only manually casting spells will never trigger the garlic.\n\nCount Draynor can be harmed with ordinary [[weapon]]s, but cannot be killed by them. Once his health is low enough, players must drive a [[stake]] through his heart using a [[hammer]] in order to deal the final blow. If a player does not use the hammer and stake, he will heal to full health when his health points are low. Having decent food will help for very low level players.\n\nHowever, due to Count Draynor's low magic defence, low class combat spells like [[Earth Strike]]\u00a0and [[Fire Strike]] can also severely damage him, and may be a viable option. If players decide to kill him with magic, many armours add negative stats to Magic accuracy, so players should be advised to not wear them until they come in to use the stake for the kill. With full magic gear, a level 9 mage can kill him by bringing about 10 pieces of tuna, depending on luck.\n\n1 [[Strength]]/1 [[Attack]] [[pure]]s can kill Count Draynor by using an [[iron dagger(p++)]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Count Draynor character is loosely based on Count Dracula\u00a0from the 1897 horror novel of the same name.\n*He is one of only two Vampyres to appear in [[free-to-play]] worlds. The other is [[Count Check]].\n*His monocle might be a reference to The Count from the children's television series {{wp|Sesame Street}}.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Vampyre Slayer}}\n{{Vampyres}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]",

Alternatively a [[burning amulet]] can be used to teleport to bandit camp and run to the ruins.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Quotes==\nOne quote is said every time Bellock attacks the player.\n*\"''I'm Bellock -

They are often assigned as [[Slayer]] [[Slayer task|tasks]] by [[Vannaka]]. Bring [[waterskin]]s to avoid dying of thirst.\n\nA great place to fight crocodiles is on the south side of the river, directly south of the small island where the crocodiles spawn. Because crocodiles are [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]] from a few squares away, this place attracts crocodiles from in the water where they cannot usually be reached, and is much less click intensive. There is a [[safespot]] for crocodiles directly west of the [[Magic carpet]] at Nardah, on a cactus near the river northwest of the crack in the desert. There are two crocodile spawns that can be safespotted, which makes the task considerably easier.\n\nAnother place to fight crocodiles (if [[Icthlarin's Little Helper]] has been completed) is just north of\u00a0[[Sophanem]], by the river just outside the gate. There is an altar for prayer, and a sink just south of that inside of the city, allowing for prolonged trips.\n[[File:Crocodile safespot.png|frame|Safespotting crocodiles west of [[Nardah]].]]\n\n==Tips==\n*If players have completed [[Spirits of the Elid]], they can use the shrine in [[Nardah]] to recharge their Prayer points, [[run]] energy, and [[Hitpoints]]. There is also a fountain to fill waterskins with.\n*Although Vannaka suggests using a\u00a0[[Stab weapons|stab\u00a0weapon]] for melee, crocodiles lack defence in all 3 melee attack styles; making any melee weapon sufficient.\n*Bring a [[Weapons#Ranged weapons|ranged weapon]] to range the crocodiles from across the river, as they can swim in the water.\n*[[Magic]] attacks work well, with the crocodiles taking damage with nearly every hit. They are weak to\u00a0[[wind spells]].\n*[[Waterskin]]s\u00a0are highly recommended when fighting in the desert. [[Desert clothing]] is as well, but it has low defences so some players instead wear good [[armour]] and bring more waterskins. Other players wear desert clothing and use a protection\u00a0[[Protect from Melee]]\u00a0to avoid some damage, and recharge their Prayer points at the altars in\u00a0[[Nardah]] or\u00a0[[Sophanem]].\n*Players wishing to buy food can take a small amount of [[coins]] to buy\u00a0[[kebab]]s\u00a0from [[Ali the Kebab seller]] (they cost 3 coins each) or [[jugs of wine]] from [[Ali The barman]] in Pollnivneach. Players may also sell noted food to the [[general store]] and buy it back in item form, usually only losing a few coins per item, or exchange noted food with the [[Banknote Exchange Merchant]].\n*Food can sometimes be obtained by searching banana trees along the banks of [[River Elid]], which have a chance of yielding [[banana]]s.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Treasure Trails==\n*{{CrypticNPC|Killing a crocodile|elite|In a while...}}",

The Hunllef will alternate between the two attack styles every 4 attacks.\n*'''Stomp attack:''' If a player is underneath the Hunllef when it tries to attack the player, the Hunllef will perform a stomp attack which deals very high damage, similar to the stomp attack used by the [[Corporeal Beast]]. This is the only attack that does not count towards the 4 attacks.\n*'''Prayer Disabling Attack:''' When the Hunllef is attacking using magic-based attacks, it has a chance to use an attack which turns off prayers. These attacks use a different game sound, hence it is recommended to use sounds during the fight.\n*'''Tornados:''' The Hunllef summons multiple tornados that chase the player and deal high damage if they reach the players location, these tornadoes disappear after a brief period. The amount of tornados summoned increases as the Hunllef takes damage.\n\n===Damaging floor===\nDuring the fight, the floor will light up in various places. Tiles are initially highlighted in blue and soon turn orange. If the player stands on an orange tile they will continue to take high damage until they step off of the highlighted tiles.\n\nAs the fight progresses, the tile patterns become more challenging, and the tiles change from blue to orange more quickly.\n\n===Attack style cycle===\nThe Hunllef changes its prayer and attack styles on predictable cycles. Every fourth attack performed by the Hunllef (excluding the stomp attack) will cause the Hunllef to change its standard attack style; it will perform an animation before switching attack styles.\n\n===Protection prayer cycle===\nEvery sixth off-prayer attack that the player performs on the Hunllef will trigger a protection prayer change. The Hunllef will use the protection prayer used on the sixth off-prayer hit. Players can use this cycle to ensure the Hunllef never prays against their strongest attack style.\n\n==Protection against his attacks==\nPlayers can use their [[protection prayers]] to reduce the damage from the Crystalline Hunllef's standard attacks. Wearing pieces of the crystal armour will further reduce the incoming damage.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Armour combination\n!Crystalline Hunllef's max hit <ref group=\"a\">While using the correct [[protection prayer]] against its ranged and magic attacks.</ref>\n!Damage from tornadoes\n|-\n|{{NA}}||No armour||12||10-20\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Crystal helm (basic)}}{{plinkp|Crystal body (basic)}}{{plinkp|Crystal legs (basic)}}||Full T1 armour||10||10-16\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Crystal helm (attuned)}}{{plinkp|Crystal body (attuned)}}{{plinkp|Crystal legs (attuned)}}||Full T2 armour||8||7-13\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Crystal helm (perfected)}}{{plinkp|Crystal body (perfected)}}{{plinkp|Crystal legs (perfected)}}||Full T3 armour||''Unknown''||5-10\n|}\n\n{{Reflist|group=a}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"400\" heights=\"200\">\nCrystalline Hunllef artwork.jpg|A piece of official artwork depicting a player in battle with the Crystalline Hunllef.\nSong of the Elves (4).gif|Idle animation of the Crystalline Hunllef, designed by Mod Ghost.\n</gallery>\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=2 July 2020|update=Poll 71 and Death Feedback Changes|poll=Old School Content Poll 71: Gauntlet, Grotesques, CoX and more|change=The Crystalline Hunllef will now play an animation and sound effect right before it changes its attack style.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=1 August 2019|update=SOTE Changes and Small Game Updates|poll=|change=<nowiki/>\n*The Crystalline Hunllef will now use Ranged as its first attack style.\n*The Crystalline Hunllef will now deal more damage if not praying the correct protection prayer; however, damage when praying correctly has been reduced.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*'Hunllef' is Welsh for 'nightmare'.

He used the exotic and esoteric foodstuffs to which he had access to improve his magical power. In the quest [[Recipe for Disaster]], he was sealed away by [[Franizzard Van Lumbcook]], one of the Lumbridge Castle [[Cook (Lumbridge)|cook's]] forefathers, when he threatened to destroy a council that gets together for a feast every ten years. Eliminating the secret council would have been the first step in his plan for world domination.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Fighting the Culinaromancer==\nThe Culinaromancer uses melee and magic, and has a low combat level of 75.\n[[File:Culinaromancer_books.png|thumb|70px|left|The Culinaromancer throws his books to create his food-based minions.]]\nHe should not be underestimated, despite his low combat level.

Dad can be re-fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] minigame after the player has completed [[Troll Stronghold]].\n\nSince nearly all trolls are named after the thing they first ate, Dad got his name from eating (or trying to eat) his father. This is further confirmed by Dad himself, as Dad replies \"''Troll named after first thing try to eat!''\" if a player asks about his name. He challenges players, either doing [[Troll Stronghold]] or not, to fight him in the [[Troll arena]] so players can pass him and have access to the northern side of Troll Country, including the [[God Wars Dungeon]].\n\nHe will stop the player from attacking just before he dies to ask you to spare his life. It is recommended that you spare his life, because if you choose to kill him after he has surrendered, he will drop [[Big bones]] and you may continue, but all the [[Troll spectator]]s in the arena will become aggressive towards you and will try to kill you, so if you kill him, be ready to run to the northern gate. If you just let him live, he will allow you to pass through the gate anyway, and the troll spectators won't become aggressive.\n\n==Strategy==\nDad is larger and stronger than normal Trolls, so much that he actually wields a large, hollow tree trunk in battle. He is very powerful and can hit into the high 20s. His hits are slow, but fast at times. When he hits there is a 1/3 chance that he will do a giant swing that sends player flying through the air, knocking them back and momentarily [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them. [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended when fighting him. Despite his strength, Dad is notable for being one of two non-[[Aggressive]] trolls which can be fought, the others being [[Troll spectator]]s. You should stay near a wall while fighting him as this prevents his giant swing from knocking you back, although it will still [[Stun (status)|stun]].\n\nDad is unable to walk through players, so one possible strategy is to have a friend stand in his way so he can't get close enough to attack.\n\nOnce Dad is defeated, the player can no longer attack him.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Trolls}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Troll Stronghold}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]\n[[Category:Nightmare Zone]]",

They can also be found in the southern part of the {{TL}}[[Catacombs of Kourend]], as well as the [[Jormungand's Prison]] after completion of [[The Fremennik Exiles]] (type 2 in the table).\n\nThis variant of dagannoth has two levels \u2014 74 and 92. The level 74 in the Lighthouse uses a [[ranged]] attack that hits up to 10, but has poor accuracy. The level 92 dagannoth uses [[melee]], which is more accurate and hits up to 8. In the other areas, both levels use melee. The Lighthouse basement is a [[multicombat area]] and therefore many players use [[dwarf multicannons]] to train here. A dwarf multicannon cannot be used within the Catacombs of Kourend. Despite the [[Combat]] level of these dagannoth, they are considered very weak by most players especially in comparison to the stronger [[Dagannoth (Waterbirth Island)|variant]] on [[Waterbirth Island]]. They also seem to be susceptible to poison. Players with decent defensive bonuses shouldn't have any trouble fighting for long periods of time.\n\n==Tips==\n[[Protection prayers]], [[Bones to Peaches]], [[Guthan the Infested's equipment|Guthan's]], and the [[Saradomin godsword]] [[special attack]] are all viable means of surviving for extended periods. Players with 80 [[Prayer]] can use a [[dragonbone necklace]] and [[bonecrusher]]/[[bonecrusher necklace]] to sustain more prayer points.\n\nThe dagannoths in the Kourend Catacombs can be safespotted, but not reliably. If using melee, the area near safespot 2 can be used to fight only one dagannoth at a time.\n[[File:Catacombs of Kourend Dagganoth Safespot.jpg|none|thumb|Safespotting 1]]\n[[File:Catacombs of Kourend Dagganoth Safespot 2.jpg|thumb|none|Safespotting 2]]When killing the dagannoths in the Lighthouse, players can sell noted food to [[Jossik]] in the Lighthouse and buy it back in unnoted form for a small amount of money.\n\nThe dagannoths in Jormungand's Prison are in multi-combat, a cannon can be set, and only attack in melee.

Prime is the only monster to drop the [[Seers ring]] and [[Mud battlestaff]]. His projectile resembles [[Water Wave]]. He, along with the other Dagannoth Kings, can also drop the [[dragon axe]].\n\n==Strategy==\n{{Main|Dagannoth Kings/Strategies}}\nDagannoth Prime, like the [[combat triangle]] suggests, is weak to [[ranged]] attacks. The [[Armadyl crossbow]], [[Dragon hunter crossbow]], [[Dragon crossbow]], [[Rune crossbow]] and [[Toxic blowpipe]] are effective weapons against him due to their high accuracy and, for the case of the blowpipe, very high damage-per-second capability. Wealthier players may opt to use the [[Twisted bow]] due to its effectiveness against monsters with high magic. The [[Crystal bow]] is also an effective weapon to use, and it is cheaper to use because it does not use ammunition. His [[magical]] attack is very powerful and more potent than the other two kings; it can deal '''50''' [[Hitpoints]] of damage in one hit, so [[Protect from Magic]] prayer is a MUST whenever Dagannoth Prime is on you. Meleers are advised to stay away from Dagannoth Prime at all costs and fend off [[Dagannoth Supreme]] meanwhile, as Dagannoth Prime can kill any player not using the Protect from Magic prayer within a couple of attacks and is resistant to [[melee]] attacks. Dagannoth Prime still has medium [[Defence]] against ranged attacks. The most efficient way to kill Dagannoth Prime is to stand in the north-east corner of the lair while not being under attack by [[Dagannoth Rex]] or Dagannoth Supreme, using a ranged weapon.\n\n==Dangers==\n*If players get too close to [[Dagannoth Rex]] when they are fighting Dagannoth Prime, Dagannoth Rex switches his aggressiveness towards them. This can be avoided by staying on the western part of the arena, as Rex will rarely (if ever) go there.\n*[[Dagannoth Supreme]] respawns while fighting Prime. This can be avoided by staying in the northeastern part of the arena by the seaweed. Players will want to use the \"Long-Range\" style with their [[Ranged]] combat unless the player is sure that they will not get the attention of Supreme.\n*Prime, along with his fellow king Supreme, have a very long-ranged attack. This means, if he targets you, you'll either have to leave the arena or kill him.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=63560}}<!--\n-->{{#vardefine:oneprimeLoot|{{#expr:\n(1/1) * 1 * {{GEP|Dagannoth

Rex is the only monster to drop the [[Berserker ring|Berserker]] and [[Warrior ring]]s, which can become best-in-slot rings for Strength and Slash after being imbued at the [[Nightmare Zone]].

Popular choices include [[Slayer Dart]], [[Iban Blast]], and [[powered staves]].\n\nDue to his large size and the fact he uses [[melee]] attacks only, it is recommended to get him stuck on one of the ridges of the lair and [[safespot]] him (note that [[Spinolyp]]s will still be constantly attacking while you're safespotting). Many players use high-level [[armour]] such as [[Barrows armour]], which give high [[Defence]] bonuses while still being able to hit Rex constantly with [[spells]] due to his very low Magic Defence, even if their [[magic attack bonus]] is below zero. Players who use [[Guthan the Infested's equipment|Guthan's]]\u00a0are advised heal themselves on the Spinolyps while waiting on respawns to help preserve [[food]] and [[potions]].\n{{clear|left}}\n==Dangers==\n*If players venture too far out west to lure Dagannoth Rex, they risk attracting attention from both [[Dagannoth Prime]] and [[Dagannoth Supreme]], namely Prime since he wanders closer to the east and north-east.

Supreme is the only monster to drop the [[archers ring]] and [[seercull]]. He, along with the other Dagannoth Kings, can also drop the [[dragon axe]].\n\nHis Ranged attack sounds like the [[Water Wave]] spell when hitting players and, in a similar fashion to [[Magic]] attacks, will \"splash\" if it misses.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{Main|Dagannoth Kings/Strategies}}\nDagannoth Supreme is most weak to [[melee]] attacks. The best weapons to use primarily are the [[abyssal whip]] or [[abyssal tentacle|tentacle]] due to its high [[Strength#Strength bonus|Strength bonus]] and fast attack rate, the [[Saradomin godsword]] for its [[special attack]], accuracy, and Strength bonus, and [[Guthan's warspear]], which should only be used in conjunction with the full [[Barrows set]] to heal. If a player does not posses a Saradomin godsword, a [[Crystal halberd|crystal]] or [[dragon halberd]] is a good alternative [[special attack]] weapon.\n\n==Dangers==\n*The biggest threat when killing Dagannoth Supreme is that [[Dagannoth Prime]] may respawn while killing Supreme. To save yourself from Prime's hard-hitting magical attacks, turn on [[Protect from Magic]]. You can either stick around or leave up the ladder.\n*Another possible threat is that [[Dagannoth Rex]] may respawn instead of Prime. If this happens, try to position Supreme between you and Rex, and if you are a [[mage]], distract him again like in first wave. However, the mage should feel no inclination to kill Rex; just lure him away. Another strategy is to make use of [[Entangle]] or [[ice spells]] to deal with Rex.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=64276}}<!--\n-->{{#vardefine:onesupremeLoot|{{#expr:\n(1/1) * 1 * {{GEP|Dagannoth bones}} +\n(1/1) * 1 * {{GEP|Dagannoth hide}} +\n\n(7/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Red d'hide vambraces}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * 3000 +\n(1/128) * 1 * 3000 +\n(1/128) * 1 * 3000 +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Seercull}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon axe}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Archer helm}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Spined body}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Spined chaps}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Archers ring}} +\n\n(10/128) * 37.5 * {{GEP|Mithril knife}} +\n(5/128) * 7.5 * {{GEP|Rune thrownaxe}} +\n(5/128) * 17.5 * {{GEP|Adamant dart}} +\n(5/128) * 150 * {{GEP|Steel arrow}} +\n(5/128) * 20 * {{GEP|Opal bolt tips}} +\n(5/128) * 7 * {{GEP|Runite bolts}} +\n(5/128) * 350 * {{GEP|Iron knife}} +\n(5/128) * 100 * {{GEP|Steel knife}} +\n(4/128) * 450 * {{GEP|Iron arrow}} +\n\n(7/128 * 47/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Toadflax seed}} +\n(7/128 * 32/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Irit seed}} +\n(7/128 * 31/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Belladonna seed}} +\n(7/128 * 22/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Poison ivy seed}} +\n(7/128 * 22/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Avantoe seed}} +\n(7/128 * 21/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Cactus seed}} +\n(7/128 * 15/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Potato cactus seed}} +\n(7/128 * 15/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Kwuarm seed}} +\n(7/128 * 10/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Snapdragon seed}} +\n(7/128 * 7/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Cadantine seed}} +\n(7/128 * 5/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Lantadyme seed}} +\n(7/128 * 4/238) * 3 * {{GEP|Snape grass seed}} +\n(7/128 * 3/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Dwarf weed seed}} +\n(7/128 * 2/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Torstol seed}} +\n\n(1/128) * 1 * {{TalismanDTValue}} +\n\n(10/128) * 804.5 * 1 +\n(6/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Oyster pearls}} +\n(5/128) * 5 * {{GEP|Shark}} +\n(5/128) * 100 * {{GEP|Yew logs}} +\n(5/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy ranarr weed}} +\n(3/128) * 40 * {{GEP|Maple logs}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Runite limbs}} +\n(1/128) * 375 * {{GEP|Feather}} +\n\n(8/128) * 1 * {{RDTValue}} +\n(10/128) * 1 * {{GDTValue}} +\n(1/20) * 1 * {{GEP|Ensouled dagannoth head}}\n}}}}\n\nThe average Dagannoth Supreme kill is worth {{Coins|floor({{#var:onesupremeLoot}})}}.\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dagannoth bones|Quantity=1|Quantitynotes=<ref group=\"d\">Dropped in noted form if the player has completed the elite tier of the [[Fremennik diary]]</ref>|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dagannoth hide|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Reflist|group=\"d\"}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril knife|Quantity=25-50|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Red d'hide vambraces|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune thrownaxe|Quantity=5-10|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant dart|Quantity=10-25|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron knife|Quantity=200-500|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel knife|Quantity=50-150|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fremennik blade|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fremennik shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fremennik helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seercull|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|Drop Rates V2}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteForum|author=Envision|url=https://archive.fo/5P5mn|title=Drop Rates V2|name=Drop Rates V2}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/648561290034683904|date=28 September 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/knrWr|archivedate=15 April 2019|quote=1/42 for a hard clue, 1/750 for elite, 1/128 for a d axe and 1/128 for a ring.|name=Ash tweet unique rates}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Archer helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Spined body|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1016722619100487681|date=10 July 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/5HeVi|archivedate=15 April 2019|quote=Each of those items is 1/128.|name=Armour+Rings}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Spined chaps|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|Armour+Rings}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Archers ring|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|Drop Rates V2}}{{NamedRef|Ash tweet unique rates}}{{NamedRef|Armour+Rings}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel arrow|Quantity=50-250|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bolts|Quantity=2-12|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron arrow|Quantity=200-700|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|7/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{RareSeedDropTable2|7/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Talismans===\n{{TalismanDropTable|1/128}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/745561134040645633|date=22 June 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/suXO4|archivedate=15 April 2019|quote=He has a 1/128 chance of calling the talisman table;

He is the only guardian who exclusively uses [[melee]] to attack, however this is made up by him having two forms, with the second form being able to attack at a quick rate as well as draining [[Prayer]] rapidly. As with most monsters in the [[Shadow Dungeon]], Damis allows other monsters to pass through him.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Shadow Dungeon map.png|240px|left|thumb|The Shadow Dungeon.]]\nHe is found at the end of the Shadow Dungeon, which is accessed via a ladder requiring the [[ring of visibility]] to see. When approaching Damis' location, the player will be told in their chatbox that they hear a voice from the walls telling them to turn back.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Strategy==\n[[File:Desert treasure safespot.png|thumb|left|A player using a [[giant rat]] to [[safespot]] Damis.]]\nHis first form is not much of a threat as the player can use [[Protect from Melee]] to defeat him and mitigate all damage, however his second form has higher stats, attacks faster and drains the player's Prayer rapidly when close up. As such, it may not be a good idea to allow Damis to attack the player.\n\nThe best method to defeat Damis is to get the attention of (but not kill) the [[bat]] or one of two [[giant rat]]s found nearby and luring Damis and the other aggressive monsters behind it. Unlike the skeletons and Shadow Hounds, they will prevent other monsters passing through them. The player can then safely attack Damis using Magic/[[Ranged]] with only the giant rat or bat attacking the player.\n\nAs Damis is weak to Magic, [[Iban Blast]] and [[Trident of the seas]]/[[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] are effective. He is resistant to [[melee]] and Ranged. Contrary to a popular misconception, Damis is not specifically weak to Earth spells.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1028980496020242432|date=13 August 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/9U1cP|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=The ice & fire warriors have effects.

Along with their superior variant, they are the only monster in the game to drop the [[dark bow]] and the [[death talisman]].\n\nDark beasts attack with both [[Melee]] and [[Magic]]; however, they will only use Magic if they are attacked by the player first, or if they cannot attack the player with Melee. Dark beasts do not follow [[tolerance]] rules, and are always [[aggressive]] to the player regardless of how long they have stayed in their presence. Their highly accurate melee attacks means that using [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended when killing dark beasts.\n\nA [[combat level]] of 90 is required to have them assigned to the player as a [[Slayer task]], unless the player has spoken to a [[Slayer Master]] about the difficulty of assignments; progressing through [[Mourning's End Part II]] to the point where the player can access the tunnels is also required, as well as 90 Slayer.\n\nPlayers who have a [[Slayer ring]] and completed Mourning's End Part II can rub the ring to immediately teleport to the dark beasts in the Mourner Tunnels. Another fast method to reach these dark beasts is the [[death altar]] through the [[Abyss]]. If the player cannot use these methods, then they will need to enter through the [[Mourner Headquarters]] wearing a full [[Mourner gear|mourner set]] (with no non-regulated items being worn) and the [[new key]] to open the door.\n\nPlayers who can [[Protect from Melee|pray melee]], have the [[Ardougne cloak 3|Ardougne Cape 3]], and have an inventory nearly full of [[Slayer ring|Slayer Ring]]s can kill dark beasts without the need to use potions that restore prayer. This is especially useful for Ironman players as they can simply teleport between locations. This method accompanied with a [[Rune pouch|Rune Pouch]], [[Herb sack|Herb Sack]], and [[High Level Alchemy|High Alchemy]] runes means players can kill Dark Beasts for many hours without ever needing to bank.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=47056}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:onedarkbeastLoot|{{#expr:\n1 * {{GEP|Big bones}} +\n(1/512) * {{GEP|Dark bow}} +\n(3/128) * {{GEP|Black battleaxe}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Adamant sq shield}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Rune chainbody}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Rune med helm}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Rune full helm}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Rune 2h sword}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Rune battleaxe}} +\n(8/128) * {{GEP|Death rune|20}} +\n(7/128) * {{GEP|Chaos rune|30}} +\n(4/128) * {{GEP|Blood rune|15}} +\n(2/128) * {{GEP|Adamantite bar}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Adamantite ore}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Runite ore}} +\n(24/128) * 1.2 * {{HerbDTValue}} +\n(4/128) * {{RareSeedDTValue}} +\n(40/128) * 152 +\n(6/128) * 64 +\n(6/128) * 95 +\n(5/128) * 220 +\n(3/128) * {{GEP|Shark}} +\n(13/128) * {{GEP|Shark|2}} +\n(1/128) * {{GEP|Death talisman}} +\n(3/128) * {{RDTValue}} +\n(3/128) * {{GDTValue}}\n}}}}\n\nAn average dark beast kill is worth {{Coins|floor({{#var:onedarkbeastLoot}})}}, excluding the possible value of tertiary drops.\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark bow|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=20|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|override=There is a 24/128 chance of rolling the [[herb drop table]].

This monster heals the Beast, and attacks any players within the vicinity of the Core. It is advised to kill the Dark Core as soon as it is launched towards the player, as it transfers the player's [[Hitpoints]] to the Corporeal Beast and in very large clans, can be quite irritating. It can be weakened immensely by [[poisoning]] it. Once it has been poisoned, its attacks will be extremely slow, although there must be at least one player around the Dark energy core or else it will start hopping around again and will attack normally. If the Dark energy core was [[Stun (status)|stunned]] but someone moved away from him and he starts hopping around again, it cannot be stunned again. It will keep dealing damage rapidly until it is killed.

She is the [[boss]] version of the [[gargoyle]], found on the [[Slayer Tower]]'s rooftop. In order to access the roof, players must obtain a [[brittle key]] from gargoyles while assigned them for a [[slayer task]]. Similar to other [[slayer bosses]], such as [[Cerberus]] and the [[Abyssal Sire]], the Grotesque Guardians can only be killed while the player is assigned gargoyles as a slayer task.\n\nTo initiate the fight, players must ring the Cloister Bell in the north side of the roof. This will trigger a cutscene in which the Guardians will awaken, and the fight will begin. Dawn uses [[magic]], [[ranged]], and [[melee]] attacks. She has a special attack in which a grey ball is flung somewhere near her, and if the player is hit by this ball (which covers a 3x3 AoE), they will be [[Stun (status)|stunned]] and bound, similar to the [[marble gargoyle]]'s special attack.\n\n==The fight==\n''Like gargoyles, players '''must''' bring a [[rock hammer]] or [[granite hammer]] to defeat Dawn.''\n\nIn the beginning of the fight, players must attack Dawn with ranging attacks (as she cannot be harmed with melee and is resistant to magic), as [[Dusk]] cannot be harmed during this phase of the fight. Once her health has reached half, both will perform a lightning special attack that has an AoE of 3x3, rapidly dealing up to 5-10 damage per tick. After doing so, she will fly away, and players must attack Dusk. Once his health has reached half, Dawn will return to perform the lightning special attack once more with Dusk.\n[[File:Grotesque Guardians lightning attack.png|thumb|left|250px|The Grotesque Guardians perform their lightning special attack.]]\nAfter returning, she will occasionally send out three energy spheres that will grow larger over time. Players must absorb these spheres, taking small amounts of damage if absorbed immediately, and can deal up to 20 damage if players absorb them at their peak. If players ignore them entirely, each sphere will heal Dawn for 90 hitpoints when they return to her. After defeating Dawn, Dusk will absorb her essence, and initiate the final phase of the fight.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n==Drops==\n{{main|Grotesque Guardians#Drops}}Dawn does not give anything upon defeat; instead, Dusk does this.\n\n==Concept art==\n<gallery>\nDawn work-in-progress.png\nDawn work-in-progress 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Originally during the opening cutscene of the fight, Dawn had the same combat level as Dusk, with a combat level of 285. After the cutscene was over however, her combat level decreased to 266.\n*Upon release, Dawn had 600 hitpoints. This was reduced to 450 in [[Update:Game Integrity: Pickpocketing|an update]] on [[12 July]] [[2018]].\n**This changed the combat levels the cutscreen and actual fight to 266 and 228 respectively.\n\n{{Grotesque Guardians}}\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n[[Category:Slayer monsters that can only be fought on task]]\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

Two of them are fought during [[Monkey Madness II]], in the penultimate stage of the fight. After the quest is completed, more demonic gorillas can be found in the caverns alongside their [[Tortured gorilla|tortured]] brethren. They are primarily killed for their [[zenyte shard]] and [[ballista]] component drops.\n\nDemonic gorillas use all three [[combat style]]s to attack. They will change combat styles after missing three hits in that attack style. They are also capable of using [[protection prayers]], and will switch to protect from the player's attack style after taking 50 damage from it. Therefore, players must bring at least two different combat styles to kill them. As they have very high magical defence, they are most often killed with melee and ranged.\n\nThe gorillas also have a special attack where they send a rock crashing down at the player's position, which can be easily avoided by moving one tile away from the current spot when the attack was initiated. If struck by this rock, the player will take 33% of their current health as damage; it cannot kill the player by itself as a result.\n\nMost of the gorillas reside in a [[multi-way combat]] area, making it very dangerous if the player is attacked by more than one at a time. However, there is a [[single-way]] area where more demonic gorillas can be fought safely. However, if the player accidentally safespots the gorilla while it is trying to use a melee attack, it is possible for nearby demonic gorillas to attack the player if they are not [[tolerant]] yet.\n\nDemonic gorillas count as [[monkey]]s and [[black demons]] for the progression of [[Slayer task]]s. As they are demons, they are susceptible to the effects of [[demonbane weapons]]. Demonic gorillas '''cannot''' be damaged with a [[Dwarf multicannon]].\n\nPlayers can check the kill count by reading the gravestone next to [[Lumo]] at the opening in the fence.\n\n'''Note:''' The prayers of the demonic gorilla '''cannot''' be bypassed through the use of [[Verac the Defiled's equipment|Verac's set]] or [[special attacks]].\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=276492}}\n\nThe average demonic gorilla kill is worth {{Coins|floor{{#vardefineecho:oneDemonLoot|{{#expr:\n\n1/300*{{GEP|Zenyte shard}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:demonUniq|{{#expr:\n1/500*{{GEP|Ballista limbs}} +\n1/500*{{GEP|Ballista spring}} +\n1/750*{{GEP|Light frame}} +\n1/1500*{{GEP|Heavy frame}} +\n1/1500*{{GEP|Monkey tail}}\n}}}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:demonReg|{{#expr:\n(35/500) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune platelegs}} +\n(35/500) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune plateskirt}} +\n(20/500) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune chainbody}} +\n(10/500) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon scimitar}} +\n\n(35/500) * 62.5 * {{GEP|Law rune}} +\n(35/500) * 62.5 * {{GEP|Death rune}} +\n(25/500) * 125 * {{GEP|Runite bolts}} +\n(25/500) * 1000 * {{GEP|Javelin shaft}} +\n(25/500) * 50 * {{GEP|Rune javelin heads}} +\n(25/500) * 30 * {{GEP|Dragon javelin heads}} +\n\n(18/500) * (40/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Grimy kwuarm}} +\n(18/500) * (32/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Grimy cadantine}} +\n(18/500) * (32/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Grimy dwarf weed}} +\n(18/500) * (24/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Grimy lantadyme}} +\n\n(25/500) * 2 * {{TreeHerbSeedDTValue}} +\n\n(20/500) * 6 * {{GEP|Adamantite bar}} +\n(17/500) * 5 * {{GEP|Diamond}} +\n(15/500) * 3 * {{GEP|Runite bar}} +\n\n(40/500) * 2 * {{GEP|Prayer potion(3)}} +\n(35/500) * 2.5 * {{GEP|Shark}} +\n(25/500) * 7500 +\n(25/500) * 1 * {{GEP|Saradomin brew(2)}}\n\n }}}}\n}} }}\n}}, including the [[zenyte shard]] drop.

Alternatively, players with access to fairy rings can use the code {{Fairycode|dlq}} to get to them faster.\n\n{{NPC map|x=3443|y=3040|r=10|width=300|height=300|zoom=1|mapID=0|plane=0|align=right|caption=Location of the Desert lizards.}}\n\nThe lizards are found in areas affected by [[desert heat]], so players are advised to bring a [[water]] source like [[waterskin]]s to avoid taking damage from the heat. Those with access to the fairy ring system can easily refill waterskins by re-entering [[Zanaris]]; as a water fountain is located north of the fairy ring.\n\nDesert lizards can be assigned as a [[Slayer task]] by [[Turael]], [[Mazchna]], [[Chaeldar]], and [[Vannaka]]. Although the task says \"Desert Lizard\", you don't necessarily have to kill just desert lizards. Any other lizards around the area are counted toward the task.\n\nThe final blow cannot be dealt by using [[Ancient Magicks]] [[ice spells]].\n\n{{ToC}}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=614918}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic gloves (light)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=30/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=42|Rarity=14/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|10/128}} ''Any time an herb is dropped, 42 fire runes are also dropped.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable|9/128}} ''Any time a seed is dropped, 2 Waterskin(0) are also dropped.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable2|9/128|24}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Ores and bars===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coal|Quantity=1|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Copper ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=22/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Silver bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Silver ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tin ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Kebab|Quantity=1|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Waterskin(0)|Quantity=2|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n''There is a 4/128 chance of rolling once on the gem drop table, and a 2/128 chance of rolling twice.''\n{{GemDropTable|6/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}",

He must be killed during the [[Desert Treasure]] quest. The player is told of Dessous by [[Malak]], one of the four guardians of the [[Diamonds of Azzanadra]], who wants him dead in order to claim Dessous' land as his own. In order to achieve this, Malak tells the player that Dessous guards the diamond and if they wish to retrieve it they must eliminate him; it is when the player encounters Malak after the fight that he confesses that he is the real guardian and that Dessous was just an enemy of his, and then gives the diamond to the player as a reward for their troubles.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Graveyard Map.png|240px|left|thumb|The routes to the Graveyard.]]\nThe [[Graveyard]], in the south-east of [[Mort Myre Swamp]].\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Strategy==\nTo begin the fight, players must use a [[Silver pot (Desert Treasure)|blessed silver pot]] containing blood, [[garlic]] and [[spice]] on his grave. Dessous uses two attacks: a rapid [[melee]] attack (the same speed as [[darts]]) which is accurate and can hit up to 19, and a bat attack indicated by bats flying towards the player, with Dessous saying \"Hssssssssssss\", which is half [[Magic]], half [[Ranged]], each inflicting 5 hitpoints for a total of 10 hitpoints. The delay in which this attack hits the player seems to be random.\n\nDessous will detect a player's [[protection prayers]] and switch attack style accordingly. Players who will not be wearing melee [[Barrows equipment|Barrows armour]] are advised to activate [[Protect from Melee]], otherwise players who are should use [[Protect from Magic]]/[[Protect from Missiles]] so that he will only use melee. A flaw in Dessous' mechanics can be taken advantage of so he will not be able to attack the player by switching between Protect from Melee and Ranged every tick (100 beats per minute if using a metronome), causing him to teleport around but not attack (if done correctly).\n\nIf players try to hit Dessous from a long distance away, he will teleport next to them, and if Dessous teleports three times he will get \"bored of toying with you\" and go back to his grave (this means the player will have to refill the silver pot and start the fight again).\n\nDessous is weak to Magic and Ranged, then Stab. [[Iban Blast]] and [[Trident of the seas]]/[[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] are also effective.\n\nIf any part of the quest is not followed correctly (for example, if the pot is not blessed), Dessous will say \"You will never defeat me\" when reduced to 0 hitpoints and regenerate all his hitpoints, ready to fight again, so be careful! To avoid this keep full concentration at all times while making the blessed pot of blood.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDessous spawns.gif|Dessous comes out of the grave.\nDessous prayer flick.gif|A player demonstrating what happens when [[Prayer|prayer flicking]] between Protect from Ranged and Melee against Dessous, causing him to not attack.\nDessous bat attack.gif|Dessous using his bat attack.\n</gallery>\n\n==Dialogue==\nDessous has no actual\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Vampyre dust|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dessous is a French word that means \"beneath\".\n* After the player defeats Dessous, their character will say \"Well that's Dessous dead, but where is the Diamond he was supposed to have?\".

They are found exclusively within the {{TL}}[[Catacombs of Kourend]]. Directly south-east of the {{fairycode|djr}} [[fairy ring]] there is a mysterious hole for quick access to this creature, which must be accessed from below before being able to be used. The closest bank to this location is the [[Shayzien]] bank, which is south-east of the mysterious hole.\n\nLike aberrant spectres, a [[nose peg]] or [[slayer helmet]] is required when fighting them; without either, their attacks will always hit and drain your combat stats extremely quickly. They are also aggressive to players in their vicinity, meaning one is highly recommended even if only passing by. They will heal one hitpoint each time they attack the player, so it is more efficient to kill a single deviant spectre at a time than to alternate between multiple targets.\n\nAlthough they have a slightly better drop table than aberrant spectres and the ability to drop [[ancient shard]]s and [[dark totem]] pieces, their [[Defence]] bonuses are notably higher, making them overall lower profit and Slayer experience per hour. The player would also almost certainly have to use [[Protect from Magic]] as they are aggressive and found in a multi-combat zone, as opposed to using armour with high [[Magic defence]]. However, some players who can afford a [[twisted bow]] may choose to kill deviant spectres when assigned for a task, as they drop dark totem pieces and require little effort with Protect from Magic on due to their high [[Magic]] level and hence weakness to the twisted bow. They are susceptible to the effects of the [[salve amulet]] and its variants (although it is only recommended to wear one in conjunction with a nose peg, as the Slayer helmet's effects do not stack with the salve amulet).

They are very small and drop [[bones]] when found on ground. They are a fairly good way to start training the [[Magic]] skill with low-Level [[Curse]] spells and even [[Strike spells]].\n\nThe best place to kill ducks in a [[Members]] world is the [[Fisher Realm]], because there are plenty of them in a [[pond]], and there are never any other players there. The best place to kill ducks for [[Free-to-play]] is the [[River Lum]] east of [[Lumbridge]], because there are several ducks and few players take advantage of the [[training]]. You also can kill ducks and [[Drake (bird)|drake]]s north-west of [[Lumbridge Castle]] close to the chicken coop.\n\n==Fighting strategy==\nAside from using [[halberd]]s, players can usually only [[Ranged|range]] or [[Magic|mage]] them. Ranging ducks will cause you to lose your ammunition. Because of this, using Ranged to kill ducks is a method that is rarely used by most players.\n\nIf the duck is next to the shore, the player can hit it with a [[Melee]] [[weapon]], but this occurrence is rare, with the exception of the [[Fishing Guild]] docks, where there are over 20 of them, and the small [[pond]] in [[Falador Park]]. There are also some ducks on the shore beside the [[Lumbridge]] Chicken Coop.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[River Lum]], if [[ducklings]] are following the duck you killed, they will say \"Eep!\" and swim away, most likely that it was their mother. However, soon after, the ducklings will find another \"mother\" and start following that duck, and if you kill that duck they will say \"Eep!\" again and find another duck to follow.\n*At the area close to the chicken coop north-west of [[Lumbridge Castle]], when ducklings are following a duck and you kill the duck, the ducklings will say \"Cheep cheep!\" and then \"Eep!\"\n\n{{Falador farm}}",

It is the [[boss]] version of the [[gargoyle]], found on the [[Slayer Tower]]'s rooftop. In order to access the roof, players must obtain a [[brittle key]] from gargoyles while assigned them for a [[slayer task]]. Similar to other [[slayer bosses]], such as [[Cerberus]] and the [[Abyssal Sire]], the Grotesque Guardians can only be killed while the player is assigned gargoyles as a slayer task.\n\nTo initiate the fight, players must ring the Cloister Bell in the north side of the roof. This will trigger a cutscene in which the Guardians will awaken, and the fight will begin. Dusk is immune to [[magic]] and [[ranged]] attacks; only [[melee]] attacks will harm it. In addition, if players stand under Dusk in the 2nd or last phase (when they are only fighting Dusk), they will be trampled and receive 30-40 damage.\n\n==The fight==\n''Like gargoyles, players '''must''' bring a [[rock hammer]], [[rock thrownhammer]] or a [[granite hammer]] to defeat Dusk.''\n\nIn the beginning of the fight, players must attack [[Dawn]] with ranging attacks (as she cannot be harmed with melee and is resistant to magic), as Dusk cannot be harmed during this phase of the fight. Once her health has reached half, both will perform a lightning special attack that has an AoE of 3x3, rapidly dealing up to 5-10 damage per tick. After doing so, she will fly away, and players must attack Dusk.\n[[File:Dusk special attack.png|thumb|left|200px|The player is knocked back by Dusk's explosive attack.]]\nDuring this phase of the fight, Dusk's wings may glow, and will perform an explosive attack. If players do not run away from him when he does so, the player will be dealt 30+ damage and be knocked back. In addition, debris may fall around the roof, which can deal up to 10 damage and [[Stun (status)|stun]] players for a brief period of time. Once his health has reached half, Dusk will perform the lightning special attack once more with Dawn.\n[[File:Dusk 2nd form special attack.png|thumb|left|200px|The player is damaged by the prison of purple flames, healing Dusk.]]\nAfter defeating Dawn, Dusk will absorb her essence, and initiate the final phase of the fight. Here, he is stronger, can use melee and ranged attacks, and may drag players to a prison of purple flames. Players must escape the prison (by clicking anywhere outside it), or they will be dealt 60+ damage, which heals Dusk.\n\n==Mechanics==\nDusk attacks with a [[crush]] style that rolls against the player's slash defence.

'''Navigate to your Settings and set your click options to avoid attacking players.''' If you attack them, you will become [[Skull (status)|skulled]] because you are in the Wilderness, and can risk losing all of your items if you are not careful. This can easily be avoided, as the bronze armour worn by players is much darker than an earth warrior's skin, and the feather on the helmet is purple.\n\nA very small minority of Non-disguised player killers would occasionally come here. When killing Earth Warriors keep a close eye and have a plan of escape (e.g. Stay by the monkey bars to escape quickly when they spawn). Do not bring anything you can't afford to lose.\n\nIt is recommended to use [[crush weapons]] or [[magic]] as these are their weaknesses.\n\n==Locations==\n[[File:Edgeville Dungeon map.png|thumb|150px|left|Earth warriors can be found in the northern-most section of the Edgeville Dungeon.]]\n[[File:Earth warrior safespot.png|thumb|right|220px|A safespot using a rock.]]\n*The north-eastern area of the [[Edgeville Dungeon]], around level 7 [[Wilderness]].

Elder Chaos druids use [[Wind Wave]], which is fairly accurate if players are not properly equipped. They can also cast a teleportation spell that brings players within meleeing distance if the player tries to evade the battle (if there is multiple targets, even if they are attacking someone else, they will attempt to teleport the person who is running that has done the most damage to them before others). The special closely resembles [[abyssal demon]]s. Elder Chaos druids are a popular place for [[multicombat]] [[player killing]]. It is suggested to use [[Protect from Magic]] when killing these; otherwise, they can be very dangerous and can kill unsuspecting players very quickly. The [[altar]] nearby can be used to restore [[prayer points]].  Players fighting Elder Chaos druids should be wary of player killers attempting to [[Skull trick scam|skull trick]] them.   This involves the perpetrator dressing up as an Elder Chaos druid and waiting for the unsuspecting victim to attack the player killer by mistake, thus obtaining a skull.  \n\n==Location==\nElder Chaos druids reside in the [[Chaos Temple (Wilderness)|Chaos Temple]], 13 levels deep in the [[Wilderness]]. Because of the short distance from the [[altar]] within the temple, players with 37 [[Prayer]] or higher often train on Elder Chaos druids while using the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer. Training on the druids requires little resources and is relatively safe, aside from the inherent dangers of being in the Wilderness.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Zamorak robes===\n''There is a 1 in 129 chance of hitting the robe subtable.''\n\n''When players hit the table, there is an 8 in 11 chance of obtaining a piece of Zamorakian monk robes and a 3 in 11 chance of obtaining a piece of elder chaos druid robes.

Players who have completed Regicide can receive them as a [[Slayer]] [[Slayer task|task]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/713721069136449537|date=26 March 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/23AZX|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Elves: Regicide quest.}} They are usually killed either as a [[Slayer task]] or to obtain [[teleport crystal]]s\u00a0which grant quick teleportation to [[Lletya]].\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\nElf warriors have high [[Defence]] and utilise strong weaponry. The level 108 warriors use a [[crystal halberd]], allowing them to attack from 1 tile away as well as right next to the player. The level 90 warriors use a [[crystal bow]].\n\nIt is recommended to use high [[Prayer]] boosting armour (e.g. [[proselyte armour]]) whilst activating the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer when killing them. Players that have access to [[Lletya]] can easily recharge their Prayer at the nearby [[altar]] when needed.\n\nKilling the elves in Lletya (which requires starting [[Mourning's End Part I]]) is more convenient than killing [[Iorwerth Warrior]]s in the [[Iorwerth Camp]] as there is a nearby [[bank]] and an [[altar]] upstairs in the house where [[Arianwyn]] is located.\n\n==Slayer strategy==\n[[File:Elf warrior safespot (1).png|thumb|left|190px|A safespot available when slaying elves.]]\n[[File:Elf warrior safespot (2).png|left|thumb|191x191px|Another safespot available in Lletya, Elves cannot pass the yellow tiles.]]\nIf the player has 43 [[Prayer]], [[Protection prayers]] may be used while using the [[altar]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} at [[Lletya]] for [[Prayer]] restoration. The ladder is located north of the [[bank]]. Killing elves in Lletya requires starting [[Mourning's End Part I]].\n\nSome lower-levelled players may find that the safest method is to use [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] while using the west bench as a [[safespot]]. Note that the fences cannot be used as safespots. Note also that the elf warriors using melee have the same reach as a halberd, and so [[halberd]]s should not be used by the player due to the fact that they are very slow. There is also a safespot at the entrance of Lletya, just beyond the bench.\n\nUpstairs there is a [[Lletya Food Store|food shop]] run by [[Gethin]], where the player can buy [[bread]], [[lobster]]s, [[jug of wine|wine]], [[cheese]], and [[cake]]s. The shop stocks ten of each food item.\n\nAnother alternative to complete this [[Slayer task]] is to kill [[Iorwerth Warrior]]s and [[Iorwerth Archer|Archers]] at the [[Iorwerth Camp]]. The Iorwerth Camp has a [[fireplace]] and a [[fly fishing]] spot. Therefore, players can kill the elves there while supplying themselves with [[food]] through [[fishing]]. At the Iorwerth Camp the elves can be safespotted with Ranged or Magic by attacking the ones wielding a crystal halberd and using one of the several stools or spear-walls at the camp. The player needs to stay one extra space away from the stools or spear-walls so that the warriors cannot reach them with their halberd. The moss-covered rocks cannot be fired over and do not serve as [[safespots]].\n\nAnother option available to those who have started the quest [[Mourning's End Part II]] is to kill the level 108 [[mourners]] in the [[Mourner Tunnels|basement]] of the [[Mourner Headquarters]]. As these mourners are considered elves, they count toward a player's Slayer task when killed. The level 108 mourners have lower defensive stats than ordinary Elf Warriors and so may be easier to kill. However, they do not drop seeds or [[ensouled head]]s. A [[slayer ring]] may be used to teleport the player to the nearby [[dark beast]]s. It may be a good idea to use the [[High alchemy]] spell here, due to there being frequent drops of [[Green d'hide body|green dragonhide bodies]], [[Green d'hide chaps|chaps]], and\u00a0[[rune dagger]]s. Be aware after completion of Song of the Elves, the mourners will NOT be there.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=60213}}\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Green d'hide chaps|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Green d'hide body|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril spear|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=70|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=12|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=37|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead|kills=x}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|15/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=20|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=44|Rarity=29/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=180|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Crystal teleport seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=25/128|Raritynotes={{CiteForum|author=Envision|url=https://archive.fo/5P5mn|title=Drop Rates V2|name=Drop Rates V2}}|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bass|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Shark|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"d\"}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|5/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled elf head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/40}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Tide|url=https://twitter.com/JagexTide/status/1131933683714330624|date=24 May 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/WUqwD|archivedate=24 May 2019|quote=I know its been a while since the clue expansion but here is the information on clue scroll drop rates and loot chances!

She is the [[dragon (race)|dragon]] that players have to kill in the [[Dragon Slayer]] [[quest]] in the [[Crandor and Karamja Dungeon|dungeon]] below [[Crandor]]. Unlike other chromatic dragons, Elvarg has a ranged [[dragonfire]] attack.\n\nElvarg was confirmed to be female in the [[Transcript:You enjoy Postbag from the Hedge.|16th]] [[Postbag from the Hedge]], by such quotes as ''\"She wouldn't 'a had second thoughts about roasting yer with her breath\u2026'' and ''That's what she done to Crandor, after all\u2026\"''\n\nShe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete. An [[anti-dragon shield]] is provided in the arena. Unlike her quest version, this version will only use [[dragonfire]] to attack, will always drop [[Dragon bones]], and will lower stats if you have insufficient [[dragonfire]] protection.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==History==\nElvarg was created by the [[Dragonkin]] during the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]] when the Dragonkin needed to defend themselves from humans, who refused to distinguish peaceful and aggressive dragonkin. [[Zorgoth]] and other unnamed Dragonkin worked on creating [[dragon (race)|dragons]] with increased aggression. The first of these experiments took place underneath [[Crandor]], where they successfully created a green dragon with heightened aggression. This dragon was Elvarg, although she was eventually abandoned by her creators, making her home in the underground system underneath the island.\n\nElvarg went into a deep slumber, until the year 139 of the [[Fifth Age]] when a Crandorian adventurer discovered the cave system and explored the area, eventually stumbling into Elvarg's chamber. The adventurer roused her from her sleep, and she torched them in retaliation before leaving the caverns and torched Crandor completely, its inhabitants not having any sort of dragonfire protection to fight back. Crandorian survivors made a small camp near [[Rimmington]], but Elvarg pursued them and killed most of the survivors, with only three mages able to escape; [[Melzar]], [[Lozar]] and [[Thalzar]], each of whom split a map to the island and went their separate ways. The human kingdoms of [[Misthalin]] were on high alert, worried she might devastate the continent, but fortunately she returned to her chamber on the island.\n\nDuring the year 169 of the Fifth Age, an adventurer who entered the [[Champions' Guild]] looked for a quest; the [[Guildmaster]] told them to speak to [[Oziach]], who in turn told them to slay Elvarg. The adventurer acquired equipment, including an [[anti-dragon shield]] from [[Duke Horacio]], and the map from the three mages (two of which had died, while the other went insane), a ship, and a captain who was not intimidated by her reputation. They soon came upon the chamber where Elvarg was, and successfully slew her after a grueling battle, ripping her head off as proof of her demise.\n\n==Strategy==\nAn [[anti-dragon shield]] should be equipped before fighting Elvarg. As Elvarg is weak to [[stab]] attacks, a [[rune sword]] is recommended as it possesses the highest stab bonus in F2P. A [[rune scimitar]], [[rune battleaxe]] or [[rune mace]] are effective. Good-quality armour is a must; preferably [[adamant armour]] or better. Foods such as [[lobster]]s or better are optimal for fighting her.\n\n[[File:Elvarg adventurer.png|thumb|left|Remains of the original adventurer who woke Elvarg]]\n\n==Tips==\n*If a player chooses not to wield an [[anti-dragon shield]], Elvarg's dragonfire can deal up to '''65''' damage.\n*Being struck by her dragonfire attack without either an anti-dragon shield or [[antifire potion]] can\u00a0drastically\u00a0reduce [[Combat]]\u00a0and [[Prayer]] stats.\n*Members can drink an Antifire potion so that her fiery breath attack's damage is reduced. If combined with an anti-dragon shield, her dragonfire damage is significantly mitigated.\n*Standing close within her melee range could reduce the number of times she will use her dragonfire attack, as she may choose to attack with melee instead, which has a lower max hit.\n*If you happen to die, the next time you return to the fight, her health will be the same as you left her. \n*Make sure to open up Karamja's secret entrance to Crandor (By activating the wall south of Elvarg's Arena) so you can recover your equipment faster in case you die.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only in [[Nightmare Zone]]</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being a dragon, Elvarg is not vulnerable to [[dragonbane weapons]].\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[Greater demon]]|title=[[Strongest monster|Strongest monster in ''RuneScape'']]|successor=[[Black dragon]]}}\n\n{{Dragon}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Dragon Slayer}}\n{{Crandor and Karamja Dungeon}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

He later confronts the player when they and the elven clan leaders attempt to seal the Underground Pass, critically harming [[Elena]] in the process. Players must dispatch him to continue the quest.\n\nDuring the boss fight, he mainly attacks with melee. Occasionally, he will stun the player and quickly shoot an arrow that deals up to 43+ damage. This attack can be blocked with prayer if the player is fast enough.

This made him very dangerous for players who are low on [[Hitpoints]] or unattentive. Players were forced to either fight and kill the chicken or run away from it. If you managed to kill him, he dropped between 32-750 [[feathers]], [[raw chicken]], and [[bones]].\n\nThe Evil Chicken could not be attacked by anyone besides the player to whom he appeared. If the player took too long to kill him, or if they were in range but not attackable (such as if they are in a different room), the Evil Chicken would get bored and leave. The chicken could not move from the spot in which he has appeared, so if a player stepped on top of him, instead of moving to the side as other monsters will, he would shout \"Get off of me!,\" and use a [[special attack]] which will push the player aside.\n\nThe Evil Chicken's [[combat stats]] used to vary depending on the player's combat level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player level\n!Evil Chicken level\n!Hitpoints\n!Max hit\n|-\n|3-10\n|19\n|19\n|1\n|-\n|11-20\n|38\n|40\n|1\n|-\n|21-40\n|69\n|60\n|2\n|-\n|41-60\n|81\n|80\n|3\n|-\n|61-90\n|121\n|105\n|4\n|-\n|91+\n|159\n|120\n|5\n|}\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw chicken|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Feather|Quantity=100-200; 150-250|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The quantity of feathers dropped is increased to 150-250 if a [[Ring of wealth]] is equipped.</ref>{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/608017217750319105|date=8 June 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/fFTNi|archivedate=31 March 2019|quote=Although it will get you more feathers from the evil chicken if you want that.}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Evil chicken's egg|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Evil chicken's eggs are only dropped in the [[Evil Chicken's Lair]] during [[Recipe for Disaster]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The examine text \"A Fowl Beast\" is a pun, as \"fowl\" means bird, and is a homophone of \"foul\" which means evil.\n*The evil chicken spawns un-aggressively to players at the [[Champions' Guild]] near [[Varrock]].

He can also use an inaccurate melee-distance [[Magic]] attack which hits up to around 20. If Protect from Melee is used in conjunction with high Magic defence armour ([[dragonhide armour]]/[[Karil the Tainted's equipment|Karils]]), Fareed will hit very little on the player.\n\nFor players who cannot use Protect from Melee, the use of [[Snare]]/[[Entangle]] and attacking Fareed with their strongest Water spell from a distance is recommended.\n\nPlayers who opt to use Magic '''must''' use Water spells to harm him.\n\nIt is possible to kill Fareed without ice gloves while using Ranged or Magic (with a weapon) so long as the player keeps their distance from him. However, this is not possible for melee users as players who use melee will have their weapon unequipped since they are in close distance; using melee to kill him without ice gloves is '''NOT RECOMMENDED'''.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fareed (\u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f) is an Arabic word and common male name that means \"unique\".\n*If Fareed's Magic attack fails to hit, it will \"splash\" on himself rather than the target player.\nIce spells don't work on him in nmz\n{{Desert Treasure}}\n{{Smoke Dungeon}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

Feral vampyres always drop [[Vampyre dust]]. Having [[garlic]] in your inventory does '''not''' weaken Feral Vampyres{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1106580691045810176|date=15 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/nS3KJ|archivedate=28 May 2020}}.\n\nThe feral vampyres found in the Haunted Woods and Abandoned Mine will occasionally bite players, which can sometimes drain stats and will cause the vampyre to recover a small amount of [[hitpoints]]. Feral vampyres also heal 1 hit point when attacked, similar to [[Banshee]]s.

They are also the strongest of the standard giants, being significantly stronger than their [[Ice giant|Ice]] and [[Moss giant|Moss]] relatives.\n\nFire giants are assigned by a multitude of [[Slayer master]]s, providing fairly decent experience for both [[combat]] and Slayer. They're also frequently killed by [[Ironman]] players early on due to their signature [[rune scimitar]] drop, as they are fairly easy to access with numerous [[safespot]]s. Low-level players may find [[Pearl bolts (e)|enchanted pearl bolts]] helpful when [[Pay-to-play Ranged training|training Ranged]] against these enemies. Although there are many locations where [[dwarf multicannon|cannons]] can be used, none of these locations are in a [[multicombat area]].\n\nYou can tell them apart in the Catacombs of Kourend, as the level 109 giants wield clubs, while the level 104 giants wield flaming swords, which can be helpful for mobile players who would have to long press to see what level they are.\n\n==Locations==\n\n*[[Brimhaven Dungeon]]\n*{{TL}} [[Catacombs of Kourend]] (level 104 and 109)\n*[[Deep Wilderness Dungeon]]\n*{{TL}} [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]]\n*[[Smoke Dungeon]]\n*[[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]\n*[[Waterfall Dungeon]]\n\n==Location comparisons==\nIn the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] and the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]], they may be attacked safely with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. The Waterfall Dungeon is the safest place to attack them from a range because of the safespot both behind the rock in the middle of the room and in the doorway, as the giants are too large (2 spaces wide) to retaliate. There is also a safespot in the large room with 7 fire giants once they become unaggressive. Stand on one side of the long table with the Fire giant on the other side of it.\n\nThe Smoke Dungeon contains a few fire giants which are almost always empty as players are forced to bring a facemask or slayer helm to avoid smoke inhalation. There are no safespots in this location.\n\nThe [[Stronghold Slayer Cave]] has a safespot that can be used with little to no interruption from other aggressive fire giants. However, you may only kill monsters in this cave if they are currently assigned to you by a slayer master.\n\nHowever, in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], the best safespot of all becomes available after 10 minutes and grants complete protection against any attacks. In order to use the non-aggressive safespot you must walk to it first and then return to the aggressive one to wait the 10 minutes otherwise the aggression area will be reset. Killing these in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]] is often favoured if not planning to use a cannon (as they cannot be placed in the dungeon), as they grant higher slayer experience than normal and also drop [[ancient shard]]s and [[dark totem]] pieces.\n\nThe [[Deep Wilderness Dungeon]] also contains fire giants; however, given its location deep in the [[Wilderness]], it is usually only used for [[Wilderness slayer]].

If the player chooses to identify themselves as a humble pilgrim, he will comment that no pilgrims have been to the temple for thousands of years, and will tell the player that the temple is closed. Otherwise, if the player instead states that they are a mighty hero, he will become enraged and attack. He is level 84, and can only be defeated with [[ice arrows]] that are collected in the icy caverns within the temple. He uses fire-based [[magic]] attacks. If the player takes too long to kill him, he will simply disappear and the player will have to make him appear again.\n\nOnce he has been defeated, he will no longer spawn and the door can be passed freely.\n[[File:Temple of Ikov - Fire Warrior of Lesarkus.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fights the Fire Warrior.]]\n{{Temple of Ikov}}\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Flambeed is weak to [[Water spells]], [[melee]] attacks (especially crush) and [[Ice arrows]].\n\nA popular way to defeat him is to use [[Snare]]/[[Entangle]] and proceed to cast [[Water Blast]]/[[Water Wave|Wave]] while maintaining distance. A [[yew shortbow|yew]]/[[magic shortbow]] can also be used with Ice arrows in place of Water spells. This method works effectively if the player does not have ice gloves as they will hardly be under attack, alleviating Flambeed's ability to disarm the player. If melee is used, a strong crush weapon such as a [[godsword]] or [[Zamorakian hasta]] is recommended as well as wearing ice gloves, since melee users will be constantly hit.\n\nIt's rare but possible for him to spawn inside one of the portals. If this happens, he will be unable to move and players can safely attack him from a distance.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n{{Recipe for Disaster}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Flesh crawlers drop [[herb]]s often, and are frequently killed for their uncommon [[Ranarr weed|Ranarr]] drops.\n\nIt is recommended that players bring good food unless they have a [[Defence]] level of at least 40. They are good for [[combat]] training of any kind at a medium-high level (35 - 85 combat). It's beneficial to have around 40 in whichever combat skills are being used. Focused players can make upwards of 200,000 coins per hour while receiving 20,000 \u2014 60,000 experience per hour. Good drops to pick up are any noted iron ores as well as [[Nature rune]]s\u00a0and Ranarrs.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Stronghold of Security]]: [[Catacomb of Famine]]\n\n==Strategies==\nFlesh crawlers are aggressive to any level players. Range is a good strategy as there are [[safespot]]s in the rooms. It is possible to hide behind nonaggressive [[giant rat]]s in one room and range the flesh crawlers, protected from their rapid, although weak, attacks. Their attack speed is three ticks, or equivalent to the [[Event rpg]].

Unlike during the quest, deaths here are considered '''safe'''.\n\n==History==\n===Creation and Entrapment===\nThe Dark Lord was a being created by [[Seren]], when she poured her negative influences into a proxy infused with death magic to counteract the bond she had unintentionally bound her [[elves]] with in order to share some of her immortality with them. The entity immediately attacked Seren, but she defeated it and she realized that the only way to remove the curse would be gradually over time. When the end of the [[God Wars]] came, and Seren was asked to leave [[Gielinor]] by [[Guthix]], she sealed the fragment away within the [[Temple of Light]] and left the knowledge of this fragment and her past mistakes in Prifddinas' [[Grand Library]], so that the elves would at some point learn the truth about this fragment and to figure out whether they wanted to cleanse it or destroy it. From within the temple, the fragment began whispering to people in the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]], driving them mad and leading many to their deaths.\n\nAt some point during the [[Fourth Age]], [[Lord Iorwerth]] found out about the fragment after breaking the Seal of the Forgotten within the Grand Library, but misunderstood the message that Seren left behind, believing that the fragment of Seren was the goddess herself in a trapped form and began searching for a way to free it and worked with [[King Lathas]] in an attempt to free it from the Temple of Light. Lathas told an adventurer that his brother, [[King Tyras]], was forced to drink from the Chalice of Eternity by the Dark Lord, corrupting him in the process, but this was a lie.\n\nIorwerth established the [[Prifddinas Death Guard]] and had it set up base in [[West Ardougne]] under the cover that a plague had infected the city. He then began using the quarantined citizens as slaves to dig into the Temple of Light to free the Dark Lord and use its power to restore [[Prifddinas]] without the aid of the other clans, leaving the Iorwerth clan as the sole ruler of the city. The Iorwerth elves were close to gaining access to the [[Temple of Light]] as part of summoning the Dark Lord, but the plan was foiled, when an adventurer with help from the rebel elves of [[Lletya]] [[Mourning's End Part II|managed to get the temple's security system working again]].\n\n===Emergence and Defeat===\nDespite the setback, Lord Iorwerth knew that he would be able to access the temple regardless in the foreseeable future once the safeguards failed again. In preparation for this, he acquired the two orbs which served as the final key to freeing the Dark Lord from her prison. After re-acquiring the orbs that were stolen from him by the adventurer, he learned of a backdoor into the Temple of Light from a dwarvern encampment in the Underground Pass and attacked it with his forces. Though many of his warriors, including [[Essylt]], were slain, Lord Iorwerth managed to enter the temple, found the Dark Lord and freed her from her prison.\n\nThe fragment was enraged after thousands of years of imprisonment, noticed the adventurer as a non-elf and dragged them to her realm, mistaking them as one of Seren's servants sent to kill her. Though the Dark Lord had numerous powers at her disposal, she was eventually defeated. Lord Iorwerth claimed that even though she was angry, she was innocent, hurt and confused.\n\n==Combat==\nShe has an attack that is guaranteed to hit close to the players maximum [[Hitpoints]] so using [[Saradomin brew]]s or [[anglerfish]] to heal above the current max is recommended. Wearing a full set of [[justiciar armour]] to reduce the damage taken is a viable option as well.\n\nProtect from Missiles is recommended to reduce her auto-attack damage (which caps out at 12-12) to non-threatening amounts (3-3 damage).\n\nAll damage towards her is capped at 24; if players would have dealt over 24 damage to her, it is reduced to 22-24 damage. She is immune to all forms of recoil.\n\nDue to her low magic defence in comparison to other defensive stats, using [[Magic damage]] is recommended for fighting the Fragment. Because [[Saradomin brew]]s will reduce your magic level until a [[super restore]] is used, using the [[Powered staff|Powered staves]] like the [[trident of the swamp]] or [[trident of the seas]] is recommended so that you are able to continue attacking even when your magic level is temporarily reduced.\n\n==Mechanics==\nThe Fragment of Seren has 2 standard attacks:\n*A ranged attack consisting of two projectiles. The first projectile does 0-12 damage, and the second projectile does either the same damage as the first projectile, or 1 less damage (e.g. 10&10 or 10&9). Using protection prayers reduces the max damage to 3&3.\n*If you are standing beside her, she may do a melee attack. She hits 5 times in 5 ticks, dealing up to 10 damage per hit. This attack is avoidable by stepping away from her.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - fighting Fragment of Seren.png|thumb|280px|A player fights the Fragment of Seren.]]\nDuring the encounter she will cycle between multiple special attacks in this order. Each special attack is separated by about 15 seconds (usually enough time for her to do 3 normal attacks). She always announces a special attack by saying some text.\n\n*The first special attack teleports the player next to her. This will then be followed by a melee attack, so walk away quickly to avoid damage.\n*The second special attack consists of spawning of multiple copies of her, attacking the correct one (the lighter coloured shadow) will despawn the false ones and cause the Fragment of Seren to reappear.\n*The third special attack consists of multiple beams of red crystals will surround the Fragment of Seren and heal her until they are destroyed (4-8 per heal per beam). Any attack will destroy them, so using a fast attack speed weapon such as [[darts]] or [[toxic blowpipe]] will deal with them quickly, but overall they do not heal much damage so slower weapons will work as well. The beams despawn before the Fragment initiates the final special attack. Using [[Blood spells]] on the beams will heal around 5-6 health per attack, despite them having only 1 health\n*The final special attack is the most dangerous, she will teleport the player close to her and charge up an unblockable attack that's based on the player\u2019s hitpoints, dealing all the way up to the player's '''maximum hitpoints minus 1''', regardless of current hp. After clearing her third special, players should eat up close to their max hp, and then once she teleports the player eat to or above their max hp in order to survive this attack.\n\nAs the fight progresses the Fragment's special attacks will increase in power. Only the first attack is unaffected by this.\n\n1st phase (between 1,000 and 666 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 1 false clone.\n*The third special attack summons 2 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 5'''.\n\n2nd phase (between 666 and 333 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 2 false clones.\n*The third special attack summons 3 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 3'''.\n\n3rd phase (between 333 and 1 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 3 false clones.\n*The third special attack summons 4 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 1'''.\n\n==Recommended Strategy==\nThe equipment should focus on magical accuracy and strength, as defence has little effect on the Fragment's attacks.\n\n====Equipment====\n*Mage robes (i.e. [[mystic]]s, [[ancestral robes]], [[void knight equipment]])\n*[[Trident of the swamp]] (at least 300 charges) or a weapon that can autocast [[Ancient magicks]] (i.e. [[ancient staff]], [[master wand]] etc.) (if using [[blood spells]]).\n*[[Toxic blowpipe]], [[magic shortbow]] or [[darts]] (For pillars only, can be omitted.)\n*Items with magic bonus (i.e. [[seers ring]], [[occult necklace]], [[imbued god capes]], [[barrows gloves]], [[tome of fire]] etc.)\n\n====Inventory====\nDepending on strategy, a player may wish to bring a weapon switch (i.e. [[Toxic Blowpipe]]), an emergency teleport, a [[rune pouch]] and/or stacks of [[runes]].\nThe rest of the inventory should be filled with [[Super restore]]s and [[Saradomin brew]]s in a ratio of 1:3.\n\n====Strategy====\n*Drink a dose of Saradomin brew and super restore before entering the boss fight.\n*Once in the boss fight, activate [[Protect from Missiles]] and [[Mystic Might]] or [[Augury]] (for extra magic attack).\n\nIn battle:\n# Prioritise dealing damage over your current health, UNTIL the Fragment of Seren summons her healing pillars. Once you have destroyed all the pillars (or they despawn), immediately drink Saradomin brew until your hitpoints are above your hitpoints level.\n# The Seren fragment will now launch a projectile at you that deals up to max health minus 1. '''This projectile cannot be avoided.'''\n# Once the attack is over, drink Saradomin brew until your health is at a reasonable level, then drink 2 doses of your super restore potion. This makes sure your magic level stays high, so your magic attacks have a higher level of success.\n''Be wary you may need to drink Saradomin brew/super restore potion during other phases of the fight.''\n\n'''''Should the player die, their equipment can be reobtained from the [[Rebel Scout]] in the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] for a fee of 80,000 coins, provided they DO NOT die elsewhere.'''''\n\n==Ironman Strategy==\nIronmen are '''strongly''' recommended to have access to either [[Saradomin brew]]s or [[anglerfish]]. If neither of these are available, the fight is '''considerably''' more difficult, especially for players with high hitpoints, as the fragment's special will always deal near the player's max hp. Players without these will find it hard to last long enough to kill the boss before running out of supplies. Ironmen without access to these are recommended to use the highest healing food available and to use [[blood spells]] such as [[Blood Blitz]] or [[Blood Barrage]] to save on food.\n\nInventory (if brews are unavailable):\n\n*[[Rune pouch]] ([[blood spells]] recommended)\n\n*1-2 [[Prayer potion]]s\n*20 [[Anglerfish]] (if 93 hp or higher) or [[tuna potato]]es. Take several anglerfish(5-6) regardless to overheal on the final attack.\n*5-6 [[Karambwan]]s\n\nNote that it is '''not''' necessary to use a dart or bow switch for the pillars if using blood spells as despite not dealing damage, it is possible to heal from them (around 5-6 despite them having 1 hp) to save more food.\n\nAnother tactic for ironmen without access to brews/anglerfish is to use [[Redemption]] every time she uses her special attack to damage 95% to 98% of the player's Hitpoints. Heal to full before the special attack comes. Use 1 prayer dose per cycle with 70 Prayer.\n\n==Quotes==\n*''She acted like I was a monster! Come... look upon her monster!''\n*''She left me, like I wasn't real! But I know what's real, do you?''\n*''Did she think I would rot here? I am eternal, unlike you!''\n*''She feared my power, and she was right to! Let me show you...''\n*''Look at me! Look at what she made me! Do you see?''\n*''She treated me like I was less than her, but I'm so much more!''\n*''I won't let her destroy me! She doesn't get to decide that!''\n*''This power, she gave it to me! It's her power too! Feel it!''\n*''I just wanted her to love me, but she wouldn't even look at me!''\n*''She tried to forget me, but everywhere she looked she saw me!''\n*''I have more power than she ever did! I will survive!''\n*''Do you know pain? I do! She made sure of that! I'll show you...''\n*''Come! Come look upon her work, and despair!''\n*''Do you think she cares? Maybe reality isn't what you think...''\n*''I am infinite! As hard as she tries, I can't be destroyed!''\n*''The pain she caused me, let me give you a taste of it!''\n*''Are you afraid? Too scared to even look at me?''\n*''I'm better than her! I'm greater than her! That's what she hated!''\n*''The things I've endured, do you think you could endure them?''\n*''She didn't love me! She feared the strength of her own creation!''\n\n{{Song of the Elves}}",

He was a [[Dragon (race)|dragon]] incubated by the [[Dragonkin]] [[Zorgoth]], who planned to use Galvek to destroy humanity after being imprisoned for ages because he was presumed to be a violent Dragonkin. Zorgoth gave it the name \"Galvek\" because it was the Dragonkin word for \"Fate\". Galvek is a special breed of dragon, as it is more serpent-like and has the ability to control other dragons.\n\nGalvek was later killed by the player in a prolonged battle. He attempted to launch a final ball of [[dragonfire]] at the player, but collapsed before he was able to do so, incinerating his creator instead.\n\nAfter the quest, players can fight Galvek again through the [[Pool of Dreams]] in the [[Myths' Guild]]. Deaths here are considered safe.\n\n==Mechanics==\nGalvek has 1,200 health and four phases, with each phase consisting of 300 [[Hitpoints]] each. He uses all three forms of [[Combat]], and a special [[dragonfire]] attack which is capable of killing players in one hit if they do not move away from it, regardless of their protection. If next to the tile, which was hit by dragonfire, players take half the damage instead.\n\nThe effects of [[super antifire potion]] ''do not'' work against Galvek.\n\nHe can also launch pink dragonfire, which disables all prayers upon impact.\n\n===Phase I (Fire)===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's fire traps.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's fire traps during phase 1.]]\nGalvek stands at the bow of the ship, attacking players with [[Melee]] and [[Magic]]. He can occasionally launch fire bombs, which if touched (bombs cover a 3x3 radius), will deal an incredible amount of damage, and will very likely instantly kill the player. These fire bombs are always placed in the same position, and will explode after a set amount of time has passed. This phase is common to die in due to players trying to move to avoid his [[dragonfire]] attack or moving at the same time Galvek teleports them, resulting in the player running into a bomb and dying.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Phase II (Air)===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's hurricane.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's hurricane attack during phase 2.]]\nGalvek takes on the powers of air, flying towards the western side of the ship. He can occasionally launch gusts of wind that drain the player's stats by 2 and run energy by 40%. Galvek also begins to use [[Ranged]] attacks here and uses his Ranged and [[Magic]] attacks at random.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Phase III (Water)===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's tsunami.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's tsunami attack during phase 3.]]\nGalvek takes on the powers of water, flying towards the eastern side of the ship. He can occasionally send out tsunami waves (acting much like the [[rsw:QBD|Queen Black Dragon's]] firewalls in ''RuneScape 3'') '''along with''' the standard one-hit fireball. If hit by these waves, the player will take damage equal to their health. Phase III has the potential to be Galvek's deadliest phase, as the player is incredibly limited to movement if Galvek launches his tsunami and his fireball subsequently, leaving almost no room for error. Galvek also uses [[Ranged]] attacks much more commonly in this phase.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Phase IV (Earth)===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - entombed in rock.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's rock tomb attack during phase 4.]]\nGalvek takes on the powers of earth, landing on the middle of the ship. He can occasionally launch earth projectiles, which if the player is caught in, will be bound for several seconds. This deals no actual damage to the player, but leaves them extremely vulnerable to the highly damaging [[dragonfire]], which he almost always uses if he is successful in binding the player. His earth attack can be avoided by simply moving one square. Moreover, walking in circles around Galvek allows the player to avoid his rocks and dragonfire.\n\n{{Dragon Slayer II}}\n{{Dragon}}\n[[Category:Old School-exclusive content]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Those found in the basement are only available to players who are assigned gargoyles as their [[Slayer task]]. If they attempt to kill them off-task, [[Raulyn]] will prevent them from attacking.\n\nGargoyles, like [[rockslug]]s, cannot be killed normally. In order to kill a gargoyle, a [[rock hammer]], a [[rock thrownhammer]] or a [[granite hammer]] must be used when they reach 8 or lower [[Hitpoints]]. Normally, the item must be used on the gargoyle, but players can buy the \"Gargoyle Smasher\" perk from [[Slayer master]]s for 120 [[Slayer points]], which will automatically smash the gargoyle when it falls to 9 or lower Hitpoints, provided that the player has a rock hammer (or equivalent) in their inventory. The granite hammer will automatically smash gargoyles even without the perk if it is equipped.\n\nBecause of the number of [[rune item]] drops, it is recommended to bring [[High Level Alchemy]] runes to reduce the frequency of banking and save inventory space.\n\nGargoyles can be [[safespotted]] near the doorway in the south-west area at the top floor in Slayer Tower or in the north-east corner of the basement behind an immovable bucket on the floor.\n\nIt should be noted that the gargoyles on the top floor of the tower are located after [[aberrant spectre]]s, who drain players' stats if they are not wearing a [[Slayer helmet]] or [[nose peg]]. They may be avoided by using the Agility shortcut in the north-east from {{FloorNumber|2}} to {{FloorNumber|3}}, although this route takes longer.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1006920421080518657|date=13 June 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/oD4Kr|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DflMyA6X4AEtgvu.jpg:large]|name=twitter}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Granite maul|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/256}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic robe top (dark)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=75|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=150|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold ore|Quantity=10-20 (noted)|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Pure essence|Quantity=150 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel bar|Quantity=15 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold bar|Quantity=10-15 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril bar|Quantity=15 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=400-800|Rarity=28/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=500-1000|Rarity=20/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10000|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|5/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|111|bonus=yes}}|Raritynotes=<ref group='d'>Only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brittle key|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/150|Raritynotes=<ref group='d'>Only dropped if the player has not unlocked the roof access, does not have one in their bank or inventory, and has gargoyles as their current [[Slayer task]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=15 September 2016|update=Superior Slayer Encounters|poll=Old School Content Poll 47: Rewards for Raids & Slayer|change=The drop table was improved to include more valuable drops.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}",

He survives and later appears in [[The General's Shadow]] [[Miniquests|miniquest]].\n\nAfter the quest, he can be found on the second floor of the Fight Arena building, and may be fought if he was not defeated during the quest.\n\n==Shadow Sword==\nKhazard is also featured during [[The General's Shadow]] [[Miniquests|miniquest]] where the player meets Khazard's ghost in the Fremennik Forest. The General appears to have forgotten the player's role in his defeat, as he charges them with speaking to several messengers scattered across [[Gielinor]]. After this is done, Khazard tells the player to visit the [[Goblin Cave]] near the [[Fishing Guild]] for their reward. The \"reward\", however, is a lie, as the General does indeed remember the player's name, and sets a trap for them. Upon entering the cave, the player is ambushed by the spectre of the General's pet, [[Bouncer (ghost)|Bouncer's ghost]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThis is not his true form, and he probably thinks other [[Mahjarrat]] are weak themselves, as he refers to \"them\" as cunning, not strong. He has some influence in the [[Shadow Realm]], as he was able to send some of his scouts to spy on human strongholds.\n\n==Trivia==\n*General Khazard seems to wield an [[iron 2h sword]] with one hand, yet attacks with two. Similar to [[Vannaka]]'s case, who wields a [[dragon sq shield]] and a [[steel 2h sword]] with both hands.\n*General Khazard seems to wield an iron 2h sword, but he has the same [[attack speed]] as a [[scimitar]], which has an attack speed of 4.\n*General Khazard's face appeared as a skull, just like many other of his fellow [[Mahjarrat]].\n\n\n{{Mahjarrat}}\n{{Fight Arena}}\n{{The General's Shadow}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest NPCs]]\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

When they first appear they are invisible and have no [[combat level]], and try to turn food into useless [[rotten food]]; if players have no food they will do damage instead. Building the [[Fire of Dehumidification]] in the area stops these attacks (requires the completion of [[Making Friends with My Arm]]).\n\nGhasts can only be killed after completion of the [[Nature Spirit]] quest. You must have a [[Druid pouch]] and [[blessed silver sickle]] to kill them. You must use the ability of the blessed silver sickle near some dead logs or bushes to harvest [[Mort myre fungi]], [[Mort myre stem|stems]], or [[Mort myre pear|pears]] then put those into a druid pouch by ''filling'' it. When your druid pouch has been filled, you can use it to make a Ghast visible, or wait until a Ghast attacks you to make it visible. This renders the Ghast vulnerable to attack; killing it rewards the player with 30 [[Prayer]] experience.\n\n==Ghast hunting notes==\n[[File:Ghast dying.gif|thumb|A ghast dying.]]\nDue to the nature of making the Ghasts visible, they are not good for [[combat]] training. They do drop lots of [[herbs]], but so do [[Hobgoblins]]. The material drops are pretty weak as well. You do, however, gain reasonable Prayer XP as well as Combat XP for killing them.\n\nThe best place to hunt them would be just west of the [[Nature Grotto]] from the [[Nature Spirit]] quest. This allows you to keep refreshing your [[prayer points]] without using valuable [[prayer potions]]. The silver sickle does not have to actually be equipped to gain its benefits, it just has to be in your inventory. A player can use whichever weapon they choose for combat, not having to use the sickle. Fully charge your prayer points, go west of the Grotto (where the Ghasts are) and cast [[Bloom]] with the sickle next to the rotten logs. Try and do it between 2 logs, and you will occasionally get 2 mushrooms to put in the [[Druid pouch]]. Do this over and over until you are out of prayer points. Now \"use\" the filled pouch on the ghostly Ghasts - do not wait for them to attack you. Often they will just float around, or the pouch will activate itself, allowing the solid Ghast to float out over the water where it cannot be attacked. The drops will more often than not fall under the rotten logs, so search the ground carefully after defeating the Ghast.\n\nYou can actually fill the druid pouch much faster if you cast bloom near fallen tree branches, their trimmings count for 2 in your druid pouch as opposed to mushrooms only counting for one charge.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=35328}}\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Body rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|33/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|33/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=18|Rarity=21/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=26|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=35|Rarity=6/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fishing bait|Quantity=7|Rarity=26/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tinderbox|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Eye of newt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tin ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|naturetalisman=yes|chaostalisman=yes}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=5 March 2015|update=Achievement Diaries|poll=Old School Achievement Diary Rewards Poll|change=There is now a 50% chance that a ghast will ignore you instead of attacking if you have completed the [[Morytania Easy Diary]].}}\n{{Subject changes|date=5 March 2013|update=Patch Notes (5 March 2013)|change=The food-rotting special attack of ghasts has been adjusted slightly to fix a bug.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Temple Trekking}}\n[[Category:Morytania]]",

When a ghoul has low [[hitpoints]], it will stop attacking the player and [[retreat]], allowing other ghouls to attack. Applying [[poison]] can be an effective method of killing the previous Ghoul whilst attacking the next one. However, due to their low accuracy and high HP, they are generally a good place for higher levels to train.\n\nAn efficient way to kill a Ghoul can be through [[magic|mage]] or [[ranged]], melee is optional but remember they do flee when their health gets low.\n\nCurrently it is possible for a Ghoul to randomly attack a Player lower than level 84 combat, ignoring any current engagement that player may be in. This is especially annoying as you won't be able to secure the kill to get the [[Slayer]] xp, because the game will say \"I'm already under attack\".\n\n==Locations==\n*South of the [[Slayer Tower]]\n*North of [[Mort Myre Swamp]]\n\n[[File:Ghoul safespot.png|left|thumb|200px|A recommended [[safespot]].]]\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ghoul bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/4|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Ghoul bones are only dropped during [[Rag and Bone Man II]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ghoul champion scroll|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}",

A [[spade]] is required to enter its lair. A [[light source]] is also needed to be able to see in the dark tunnels. A [[bullseye lantern]] is highly recommended, as any light source that is not protected will extinguish, and the [[candle lantern]] will rarely break, with the candle disappearing, if he retreats within [[melee]] range. If you are using an unprotected light source such as a [[candle]], you will need a [[tinderbox]] to reignite it. If you have achieved 99 [[Firemaking]], you can also bring the [[Firemaking cape|Firemaking Skillcape]] either equipped or in your inventory, as it will act as a lightsource that cannot extinguish. Alternatively, if a player has completed the quest [[Making Friends With My Arm]] and has lit the [[Fire pit]] within the lair, they will no longer need to carry a light source in their inventory.\n\nWhen using the [[Serpentine helm]] or other [[venomous]] weapons, the mole will have a chance to be inflicted with regular [[poison]]. The Giant Mole cannot be inflicted with venom.\n[[File:Fighting the Giant Mole.png|thumb|left|280px|A player fights the Giant Mole, the result of an accident involving [[Wyson]] and an ultra-growth potion.]]\nThe most common method of killing the Giant Mole is with [[Dharok the Wretched's equipment]] and 1 health (often achieved by guzzling a [[Dwarven rock cake]] or by using a [[Locator orb]]), as well as having the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer active to avoid taking any damage. This results in higher hits that decrease the time it takes to kill it significantly.\n\nThe alternative to this low health method, for those uncomfortable with [[combat]] at low health (e.g. [[Hardcore Ironman]]), is using your best [[Strength#Strength bonus|Strength bonus]] [[melee gear]], or [[best-in-slot]] [[ranged gear]] with a [[Twisted bow]], the latter of which is the fastest method of killing it.\n\nHaving the [[Falador Diary#Hard|Falador Hard Diary]] completed is recommended, as it will provide you with the [[Falador shield 3]].

Players are highly recommended to activate the [[prayer]] [[Protect from Missiles]] when fighting this creature. [[My Arm]] will also attack the bird, but his attacks only tend to hit 1 to 3, so the player should not rely on this. Players should beware, as this monster can easily kill those who come unprepared. A one-click teleport is '''highly''' recommended.\n\nDuring battle, the Giant Roc will frequently buffet the player with its wings, knocking them backwards and damaging and [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them for a short time. This can be countered by standing against a rock or wall, but the attack will still stun. Although the Roc has high magic defence, its magic level is 1, meaning that it is still possible to hit it hard with spells like [[Iban Blast|Iban blast]].\n\nPlayers can usually only land a few hits on the Roc before it blows them back, making it fairly hard to fight. If players do not wish to melee the Roc up close, then they can try ranging the Roc with their backs to the wall or behind the farming patch.\n\nThe Giant Roc '''will''' destroy a [[dwarf multicannon]] if a player uses one.\n\nThere are two safespots for mages and rangers. One on the far end of the mountainside, where the ladder is, and the other north of My Arm, the goutweed patch and the rocks where the Troll Stronghold herb patch later becomes available. By positioning yourself correctly, the Roc's massive size will make it unable to pass the torch that is between it and the ladder or My Arm, the goutweed patch and rocks, meaning that it cannot come close enough to melee you. Combine this with protect from missiles and the only thing you have to worry about is the Roc's buffeting wings, making this fight not nearly as difficult as usual.\n\n'''Pure/Low defence/No protection prayers tactic:'''\n\nHide yourself behind the goutweed to protect yourself from the Giant Roc's melee attack. Similarly, the small rocky outcrop next to the goutweed is a ''total'' safezone if you need to heal etc. The Roc's ranged attack '''is dodgeable''', but requires a good rhythm which is messed up every time the Roc pushes you around.\n\nJust keep strafing forwards and backwards every time in between the ranged attacks (with run on) and shoot ''twice'' in between strafes with a shortbow, or cast ''one'' spell. This will make the Roc's rocks fall behind you, which makes you not take any damage whatsover.\n\nThe buffeting wings will still damage you however, so remember to eat whenever necessary (best to eat while stunned since you can't move anyway).\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Giant Roc is the ''RuneScape'' counterpart to the legendary Persian bird, the [[wikipedia:Roc (mythology)|Roc]].

When approached, they attack, unless they have become [[Tolerance|tolerant]], in which case they remain as \"boulders\" - attempting to cast a spell on them gives the message \"You can't attack this NPC.\"\n\nGiant rock crabs are only initially aggressive if they are approached while dormant. Once they are moving and the targeted player is out of range, they stop being aggressive and will ignore players that don't attack them. They eventually become dormant boulders again after a while if they are not attacked.\n\n==Locations==\n*In [[Waterbirth Island]] Dungeon (a partner or a [[pet rock]] required to open the door).\n\n==Strategy==\nThe giant rock crab is one of few monsters in RuneScape that will [[retreat]] from battle when they become critically wounded. This can be troublesome, as they are found in a single-way combat area. This can be prevented by attacking them while their back is turned to a nearby wall, so that they move away from the player and back up into the wall. If they move too far away, the player will follow them and risk being attacked by another rock crab. There are several protruding sections of the walls in the area that can be used as safespots which are ideal as the crabs' main weakness is magic.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=1715}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black claws|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rock-shell gloves|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rock-shell boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=1-40|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=1-40|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|8/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|8/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|1/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{RareSeedDropTable2|1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Talismans===\n{{TalismanDropTable|10/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{TalismanDropTable2|10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1-140|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw lobster|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw bass|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tinderbox|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Casket|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rock-shell splinter|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rock-shell chunk|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rock-shell shard|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (medium)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Tide|url=https://twitter.com/JagexTide/status/1131933683714330624|date=24 May 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/WUqwD|archivedate=24 May 2019|quote=I know its been a while since the clue expansion but here is the information on clue scroll drop rates and loot chances!

It summons level 68 [[Locust rider]]s and [[Scarab mage]]s to aid it in battle. The scarab is the sixth-highest level quest only monster that is fought via conventional means in the game.\n\nIt can hit around 20 hitpoints with [[melee]] and [[ranged]] and is very [[poison]]ous, with the poison damage starting at 9. If the player is out of melee distance from the scarab and has [[Protect from Missiles]] active, a message will appear in the player's chatbox \"The scarab clacks its mandibles and you are mystically poisoned\", inflicting them with poison.\n\nThe grey object in its back is [[Kaleef]]'s [[Keris]] dagger.\n\nIt can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete. Unlike the quest battle, the player can use [[Keris]] there.\n==Strategy==\n[[File:Giant scarab appears.gif|250px|thumb|left|The Giant scarab manifests itself.]]\nThroughout the fight, the scarab will summon minions to aid it, which will use a random attack style, and the player is likely to be affected by multiple attack styles at once. This may not occur, if you manage to kill the scarab very quickly. Players fighting the scarab up close should activate [[Protect from Melee]], while players attacking from afar should activate Protect from Missiles. The scarab is resistant to melee, although weaker to stab than any other melee style, so a [[Zamorakian spear]] is recommended over an [[abyssal whip]].\n\nUsing [[Verac the Defiled's equipment|Verac's set]] and the Spike attack style is also a good idea due to the high melee/Ranged defence bonuses the set provides, and the [[passive effect|set effect]] being able to ignore the scarab's Defence, as well as taking advantage of its stab weakness.\n\nThe scarab also has fairly low Magic defence, so a [[Trident of the seas]]/[[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] or [[Iban's staff]] is ideal if using [[Magic]], with good Magic armour worn such as [[Mystic robes]]. However, players with 60+ [[Ranged]] should have no problem killing it in around 2 minutes. Use the best crossbow you can; for players with a lower Ranged level, using [[Ruby bolts (e)]] is effective - higher levels should consider using the [[Toxic blowpipe]].\n\nDuring the quest, the scarab is immune to poison (though not in Nightmare Zone).\n\nPlayers using Ranged or Magic should run to the south-west corner of the room with Protect from Missiles active, mitigating the melee-using [[locust rider]]s as they will be unable to reach the player and only taking damage from [[scarab mage]]s. Otherwise do the same at the lake to the north.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Keris|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Contact!}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

It is not as strong as its combat level suggests, but an [[antipoison potion]], preferably [[super antipoison|super]], is vital, as the snake is poisonous with damage that starts at 9. It fights with [[melee]] up close and [[ranged]] from a distance, but it cannot detect the use of [[prayer]]s. Like its [[Sea Snake Young|offspring]], it is vulnerable to [[Magic]]. It drops the [[heavy box]] which is needed to finish the quest, and it can only be fought once.\n\nLevel 40 [[Slayer]] is required to kill this creature.\n\nThe best way to defeat the snake is to attack it from afar with magic to exploit its weakness. Players can freely use [[Protect from Missiles]] to reduce all the damage besides poison. Other factors such as what food to bring and what armour and weapon to use are left to the player's decision. It is recommended to bring at least [[lobster]]s or [[swordfish]]. A [[dwarf multicannon]] can be setup in this area.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mist rune|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Broad arrows|Quantity=4|Rarity=2/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|5/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable|14/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable2|14/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=44|Rarity=41/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=32|Rarity=11/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=24|Rarity=9/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=23|Rarity=7/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant dart tip|Quantity=2|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fishing bait|Quantity=50|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Pearl bolt tips|Quantity=3|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water orb|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw bass|Quantity=2|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw lobster|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seaweed|Quantity=5|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Edible seaweed|Quantity=5|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Casket|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oyster pearl|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oyster pearls|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Heavy box|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (medium)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Royal Trouble}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

He has a [[Combat level]] of 138. Glod has the ability to bellow threats at players to either make them run in fear of the huge giant or charge at him in anger. He can also heal himself similar to the gorillas on Ape Atoll, making him a bit harder to kill. When Glod is killed he drops the golden goblin which is a quest item needed for the [[Grim Tales]] quest.\n\nGlod is immune to poison-based attacks. In addition, he also has the ability to disable any active [[Prayer]]s on the player, also lowering their prayer points by a noticeable amount. However, this does not work like a [[Dragon scimitar]]'s special attack, which prevents players from using protection prayers for five seconds. If you stand at least 3 steps away from him, he will not be able to use his melee attacks.\n\nA good method of fighting Glod is with magic, standing at the edge of the arena as to render his bellow that makes players run away useless. Players will then only have to worry about the bellow that makes them charge forward.\n\nAlternatively, using melee with Protect from Melee will negate damage from his attacks.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut sapphire|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Watering can(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Golden goblin|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Golden goblins are only dropped during [[Grim Tales]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Upon release, Glod could be fought an infinite number of times.

You wouldn't like Glod when angry!\" These are both a reference to the Marvel Comics hero, the Incredible Hulk, who says \"Hulk smash!\" and \"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\"\n*Glod's appearance is very similar to that of the Incredible Hulk. It might be possible that Glod's design was based on him.\n*Glod is one of the few NPCs that actually has visible fingers.\n*Glod was featured as the first question in the RuneScape quiz 14.

In the [[Grand Tree]] quest, he can be found just south-east of the starting point of the Grand Tree; look for a ladder to the East of the ramp (between start of the quest and the agility course) that leads to Glough; take this ladder up to find Glough on the second floor.\n\nGlough's schemes are thwarted in [[The Grand Tree]] quest, and once again in [[Monkey Madness I]]. He used to be the head tree guardian of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. He makes his first unsuccessful attempt on the player's life when he summons a [[black demon]] to kill them in The Grand Tree, and again in Monkey Madness when it is discovered he has another \"pet\", the [[jungle demon]], that he uses to further his schemes, which is destroyed by the 10th Squad. During [[Monkey Madness II]], the player manages to break the alliance between Glough and the monkeys by sabotaging [[Awowogei]]'s forces, along with his alliance between the ogres and trolls. Becoming increasingly deranged and desperate, Glough launches an attack on the [[Grand Tree]] by himself. He eventually meets his end at the hands of the player after a great skirmish, but not before killing [[Nieve]].\n\n==Quests==\n===The Grand Tree===\n[[King Narnode Shareen]] sends the player on a mission to discover why the Grand Tree is dying. Little do they know that the wheels of Glough's dreams of world domination and hatred of humans have been put in motion, and is in the process of preparing an armada of warships to strike at the heart of the human kingdoms.\n\nIn The Grand Tree, players discover that Glough has hired a man named Charlie to steal the [[Daconia rock]]s\u2014magic stones kept by one of the original creators of the Grand Tree, [[Hazelmere]], that can be used to wound and even kill the Grand Tree\u2014so that he can frame him as the one who is responsible for the dying Grand Tree. Glough has used these rocks on the roots of the Grand Tree to wound it. In framing Charlie, he attempts to convince King Narnode that humans are trying to destroy the Grand Tree, which the King initially believes, so Narnode prepares for war against the human kingdoms.\n\nThe player eventually finds evidence of Glough's culpability in these plans and discovers that Glough has contracted workers to construct large warships in a distant [[Ship Yard]] to invade the human territories and attempt to control the world. After presenting this evidence to the King and following an investigation of Glough's estate by the King's subjects, the King explains that all they found were a couple of sticks. When the player deciphers the meaning of these sticks and takes them to their intended area, the player finds themselves entrapped by Glough who sets a [[black demon]] on them. The player kills the Demon and finds King Narnode at the end of the passage with his troop inspecting the roots and finding the rocks. Under the weight of all of this evidence, King Narnode has Glough placed under house arrest and cancels the invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, an angry Glough plots his revenge against the player.\n\n===Monkey Madness I===\nKing Narnode sends the player to investigate the disappearance of the elite 10th squad, who were tasked with decommissioning the Shipyard where Glough was preparing an armada to attack mankind. It turns out that the 10th Squad crashed on a small island south of Karamja due to powerful winds that damaged their gliders. When most of the squad leaves the island to inspect a nearby atoll that had been spotted prior to the crash, several of them are captured by sentient apes who imprison them. Some of the 10th squad successfully escape, while two conduct espionage and three others work on carrying out a rescue operation for those captured.\n\nWhen [[Daero]] gives the player a puzzle box to solve, the player can alternatively bring it to Glough to have him solve it for them. However, Glough will charge the player 200,000 coins before nearly completing the puzzle for them, not completing it as it would have set off an alarm.\n\nIn Monkey Madness, players discover that [[G.L.O. Caranock]] is continuing Glough's plans for warfare with the humans, in the apparent absence of a confined Glough. [[King Awowogei]], the leader of the apes, is eventually found to be conspiring with Glough's henchmen to attack mankind. By utilising a technological breakthrough privy only to Glough and his circle, they will be able to teleport all of the 10th squad to an arena with an enormous Jungle Demon to have them killed off. Fortunately, the squad commander, Sergeant Garkor, learns of their intent before they act on it, and with a bit of ingenuity, enables the player to teleport with the 10th squad when it happens. The demon is defeated, and it appears that Caranock's and Awowogei's plans are foiled for the time being.\n\nAfter Monkey Madness, Glough can still be found in his treehouse, and when spoken to, says, \"''Mark my words, the monkeys are listening''\". This is a hint towards the [[Monkey Madness II]] quest.\n\n===Monkey Madness II===\nGlough mysteriously disappears from house arrest, which prompts King Narnode to send the player to find out what he is plotting. It is soon revealed that [[Assistant Le Smith]] had smuggled him out of house arrest and dropped him off at Ape Atoll.\n\nGlough has been experimenting with the monkeys and gorillas of Ape Atoll with an unknown mutagen. [[Awowogei]] was unaware of this, and had simply labelled it as Kruk's \"secret weapon\". When the player arrives on Glough's airship disguised as Kruk, Glough tells them to send the remaining three [[tortured gorilla]]s back into their cages, as they had broken out. After the gorillas are thrown back into the cage, Glough tells them that the mutagen is almost perfect, and that he is aiming to create a mutagen that makes the applicant more aggressive, but obedient to the controller. He leaves the player to find Le Smith; the player quickly sabotages the onyx charging the mutagen.\n\nAfter finding Le Smith, Glough hears about the monkeys backing off their attack. Despite this, he still continues onward. While on the airship, the tormented gorillas break out and crash the ship. Glough manages to survive the crash and takes his best \"experiments\" into [[Crash Site Cavern|a cavern]]. When the player and Nieve arrive, Glough realises that the player had been foiling his plans all along, and sends his two tortured and [[demonic gorilla]]s at them; however, the player and Nieve are able to defeat them. Glough becomes angered and drinks the remaining mutagen to finish off the player and Nieve. Nieve attempts to stop Glough, but the mutated Glough slams her into a wall and stomps the ground, causing a boulder to crash and kill Nieve.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Fighting Glough.png|thumb|250px|The player fights a mutated Glough.]]\n\nAfter a very long battle between the mutated Glough and the player, Glough is eventually defeated. However, the caverns become increasingly unstable due to Glough's actions and collapse, presumably killing him.\n\nAfter the quest, Glough can be refought for challenge purposes by gazing into the [[burning brazier]] in [[Zooknock]]'s house in western Gnome Stronghold. This fight will record the fastest kill time, and offers no rewards.\n\n==Ancient page==\nGlough is mentioned in Gnomish language on [[My notes]] page 13.\n\n\"Laufata ki Glough ki [[Grand Tree|Ta Quir Priw]] Undo eso, Tolly, gnomo kar is Glough hamo sarko pro [[Arposandra]] Qua!\"\n\nIt has been partially translated as follows with the [[translation book]]:\n\n\"The eye of Glough of The Guardian Tree Land for, the idiot, no gnome but Glough has begone to become the Stone City Guardian!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*In {{TS|Gnomic Negotiations}}, it is revealed that a few years before current times, a [[unnamed interviewer|human]] threw a custard flan in Glough's face, in an attempt to join in with the other gnomes' fondness of practical jokes. Instead of laughing, Glough remained eerily silent.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/gnomic-negotiations|title=Gnomic Negotiations}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Grand Tree}}\n{{Monkey Madness II}}\n{{Gnomic Negotiations}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]",

At most quest states I think it'd be around 1/250.}} Because of this, it is suggested to bring a [[gem bag]] as they drop uncut gems extremely commonly.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Gorak Plane]] - code {{Fairycode|DIR}} in [[fairy ring]] network\n*[[God Wars Dungeon]]\n*[[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon]]\n\n==Strategy==\n[[File:Gorak safespot (1).png|thumb|A safespot in the Gorak Plane]][[File:Gorak safespot (2).png|thumb|Another safespot in the Gorak Plane]]\nGoraks use typeless melee, which means that [[Protect from Melee]] will not prevent or reduce damage. For every [[successful hit]] they make, a random stat of the player will be drained by one (except [[hitpoints]]). As such, [[armour]] with high crush defensive bonuses is recommended.\n\nIf a gorak successfully hits the player while any [[protection prayer]] is active, a message will appear in their chatbox saying \"Your protection prayer doesn't seem to work!\"\n\nSeveral [[safespot]]s are available in the Gorak Plane, but due to the high aggressive radius of goraks they may be difficult to use. One safespotting tactic is to use the southern walls of the inner ring, as they will get caught on the edges. If one attacks you from the south after respawning, run east/west until it can get caught on a corner, and then run back to the safespot.\n\n==Drops==\nThe Gorak drop table is very unusual. Goraks in the Gorak Plane have access to two different drop tables. Goraks in the Gorak Plane usually drop from the Gorak Plane drop table. However, if the player is in the middle of doing an uninterruptible action such as teleporting or using the [[Telekinetic Grab]] spell, the Gorak will drop from the standard Gorak drop table instead.

A large, blind, white salamander, it is one of [[Xeric]]'s greatest possessions.\n\n==Mechanics==\n===Attacks===\n*'''Standard attacks:''' Olm has two standard attacks: [[Magic]] and [[Ranged]]. The magic attacks are large green orbs, while the ranged attacks are smaller chunks of crystal. Both deal the same amount of damage.\n*'''Spheres:''' Olm randomly picks a sphere (red, green or purple) and sends it at the player. If not blocked, the player will be damaged approximately 50% of their current [[Hitpoints]]. If a [[protection prayer]] was used when the sphere was launched, it is disabled and the player's [[Prayer]] is reduced by 50%. To block the attack, pray accordingly before and as the sphere hits you:\n**'''Red''' (sphere of aggression): [[Protect from Melee]]\n**'''Green''' (sphere of accuracy and dexterity): [[Protect from Missiles]]\n**'''Purple''' (sphere of magical power): [[Protect from Magic]]\n\nThroughout the fight, Olm can also use these moves. If the left hand is clenched or disabled, these attacks will not occur:\n*'''Crystal Burst:''' Olm throws a crystal seedling under every player in the chamber. A few seconds later, the crystals burst and shove the player to a nearby tile if they are on top of them for moderate damage. The left hand will briefly show a crystal icon when using this attack.\n*'''Lightning:''' Shoots out lightning running north and/or south of the chamber. Getting hit by a bolt of lightning electrocutes the player, disabling their [[overhead prayers]], dealing moderate damage, and binding them. The left hand will briefly show a lightning bolt when using this attack.\n*'''Swap:''' Olm teleports the player(s) for damage. With one person inside the chamber, Olm will instead choose a random tile in the chamber. With two or more, Olm picks those two (or a random two if more) to teleport. To avoid damage, stand on top of the targeted tile/player. The further you are from the target, the more damage is taken. The left hand briefly shows a swirl when using this attack.\nOlm also has phase-unique attacks:\n*'''Acid:'''\n**'''Acid Spray:''' Olm spits out several pools of acid around the chamber. Standing on top of an acid pool deals 3-6 damage per tick and inflicts a weak poison effect on the player.\n**'''Acid Drip:''' Olm covers a player in acid, causing them to generate acid pools under them. Standing still will deal damage and moving will generate more pools, though it is not much of a deal in small groups. The pools are identically the same as the spray attack.\n[[File:Fighting Great Olm.png|thumb|250px|A group of players fighting the Great Olm.]]\n*'''Flame:'''\n**'''Deep Burn:''' Olm shoots out a green fireball at a player, causing them to yell \"Burn with me!\". The targeted player takes 5 damage every few ticks, dropping stats by 2 each time this occurs, for five hits. If it spreads to other players, it will reset the timer and newly infected players will initially yell \"I will burn with you.\".\n**'''Fire Wall:''' Olm shoots out two walls of fire at a player to trap them. If the player is on a tile that would be occupied by the fire wall, they will leap out and take light damage from it. After the walls are placed, the player(s) trapped inside will take heavy damage if they are not freed. To free the trapped player(s), cast a [[water spell]] or [[Humidify]] on a segment of the wall to douse the flame. This can be done outside or inside the wall.\n*'''Crystal:'''\n**'''Falling Crystals:''' Olm lets out a cry, targeting one player with a red aura. Spiked crystals fall from above, dealing damage to anyone in the targeted tile.\n**'''Crystal Bombs:''' Olm shoots out a crystal bomb (up to three at most; two for smaller groups). The bomb explodes after being deployed for several seconds, covering a radius of four tiles. The minimum amount of damage dealt is 15. The closer you are to the bomb, the more damage is incurred, up to 60 at the centre.\nThere are also attacks applied during other segments of the fight:\n*'''Autoheal:''' During the first three phases, any attacks aimed at the head are completely healed after several ticks have passed. In the third phase, the left arm also gets a variant of this ability where any attacks that deal damage will cause it to heal instead. When this is performed the left hand shows an infinity symbol.\n*'''Falling Crystals:''' During phase transitions and the last phase, Olm causes chunks of crystal to fall from above. These crystals have a 3x3 AoE. Getting a direct hit will result in moderate damage, and getting indirectly hit will deal half as much damage. One crystal will always be aimed at a random player in the chamber. A shadow will indicate where the crystal will land.\n*'''Life Siphon:''' In the last phase, Olm will shoot out two blue projectiles which generate a shield when it hits the ground. Several ticks later, Olm will damage anyone not on the targeted tiles for moderate damage, healing himself for five times the total amount of damage he deals to the team.\n\n===Fight overview===\n[[File:Mystical barrier (Chambers of Xeric).png|350px|center|The mystical barrier which precedes the boss fight.]]\nOlm has at least three phases (more depending on the size of the party), with each phase granting Olm extra attacks, indicated by the \"power\" with which he rises.\u00a0You can resupply yourself if you die fighting it.\n\nLike other bosses in the chambers, many of Olm's stats scale between its claws and head depending on the stats and amount of players in the raid, despite it having a pre-determined combat level. However, [[Monster Examine]] can be cast on him. In most small teams, its defensive and offensive stats and max hit are comparable to [[God Wars Dungeon]] bosses. If stat draining attacks \u2014 such as [[dragon warhammer]] special attack \u2014 are used, they only affect the part of him that was hit. His stats also reset when he switches phases.\n\nNote that in order to attack, Olm must find a player in the direction that it is facing due to its blindness. If no targets are in that direction, Olm will move his head to where a player is, and will also skip one attack in its attack pattern. If the player is both experienced and fast enough, they can keep Olm from attacking them. This mostly only applies to solo players as it is hard to coordinate in a group.\n\nTo progress, disable both arms. They do not have to be disabled at the same time until the final phase. Under no circumstances should you target the head until the start of the final phase, as it has a healing aura that recovers any damage it takes. On all phases but the final one, if the right hand is up, damaging the left hand will cause it to clench, making it temporarily unattackable.\n\nDuring the penultimate phase (3rd by default, 1 more for every 8 players on the team) indicated by Olm's head having a green aura, both arms must be permanently disabled quickly. If one arm is disabled and too much time passes before the other arm is disabled, Olm will regain control of that arm, and it will return with full health. The left arm will start using a rejuvenation aura after the teleport attack has been completed (symbolised as the infinite symbol), during which all damage will heal it instead. In this phase, Olm also has access to all special attacks.\n\nOnce both arms are disabled, the final phase begins. Olm's head will remain, and it will attempt to kill the team in a final stand. It will use all attacks from the preceding phases, in addition to crystals falling from the ceiling. Olm also has the ability to siphon the team's [[Hitpoints]] during this phase. If your team can damage Olm quickly, this attack can be ignored as there will still be crystals falling from above which can deal a lot of damage. Finish Olm off, and claim your rewards once it dies.\n\n===Phase rotations===\nOlm's left hand (on the right side when facing Olm) is the hand which should be disabled with [[Melee]]. This hand is also the hand that indicates which move is coming next out of crystals, lightning wall and teleport attack. At first, the next attack may seem random, but each phase does the moves in a set order. This may change between each raid but so far these are the expected rotations.\n\n*'''Phase 1:''' Crystal Burst > Lightning > Swap. After completing an attack rotation, he repeats them again. If the left hand is clenched, none of these special attacks will be performed. The left hand only clenches temporarily, and will automatically let go after a set amount of time has passed or the right hand is disabled. The left hand cannot be attacked while clenched.\n*'''Phase 2:''' The same as phase 1.\n*'''Phase 3:''' In this phase both hands have to be killed at the same time. The left hand will not clench at all during this phase. After the swap attack will come the autohealing effect for the left hand, after which the attack rotation is repeated again.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Chambers of Xeric artwork.jpg|thumb|330px|A piece of artwork depicting a group of players fighting the Great Olm.]]\n*An {{wp|olm}} is a species of aquatic serpentine salamanders living in lakes deep underground.\n*Olm made a teaser appearance on the [[2016 Christmas event]], where it killed a worker named [[Ulina]]\u00a0in a future vision.\n*The Great Olm is the only monster in the Chambers of Xeric that has a defined combat level; all other monsters encountered inside do not have any known combat level.\n**In addition, its arms also have a defined combat level (though they are still part of it, so it is still technically one monster). Interestingly enough, the left arm boasts a higher combat level than the right arm.\n* The Deep Burn attack where the player yells \"Burn with me!\" is a reference to Doctor Who S3:E7 \"42\".\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[Corporeal Beast]]|title=[[Strongest monster|Strongest monster in ''RuneScape'']]|successor=[[TzKal-Zuk]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chambers of Xeric}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]",

The greater abyssal demon will teleport around the player, hitting them quickly at an attack speed of 1 for the next four hits (one hit per teleport).

They are well known for their [[rune full helm]] and [[Clue scroll (hard)|hard clue scroll]] drops. \n\n[[K'ril Tsutsaroth]], the [[Zamorakian]] general in the [[God Wars Dungeon]], his bodyguard [[Tstanon Karlak]], and [[Skotizo]], the [[demi-boss]] in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], are considered greater demons for the purpose of a [[Slayer task]].\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Brimhaven Dungeon]]\n*[[Catacombs of Kourend]] (levels 100, 101, 113, and [[Skotizo]])\n*[[Chasm of Fire]] ([[Slayer task]] only, level 92s) - fairy ring {{Fairycode|DJR}}\n*[[Entrana Dungeon]]\n*[[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]]\n*[[Ogre Enclave]]\n*[[Sisterhood Sanctuary]] (four level 92s)\n*[[Wilderness]]:\n**[[Demonic Ruins]]\n**[[Lava Maze Dungeon]]\n**[[Revenant Caves]] (level 104)\n*[[Zamorak's Fortress]] in the [[God Wars Dungeon]] ([[K'ril Tsutsaroth]] and his bodyguard [[Tstanon Karlak]])\n\n==Strategies==\n===Free-to-play===\nThe only place [[free-to-play]] players can kill greater demons is in the [[Demonic Ruins]]. Since this is a [[multicombat area]] in high-level [[Wilderness]], there is a high risk of getting killed by other players. Because of that, the best strategy to kill these is to bring as few items as possible.\n\nTo do that, first train your [[Prayer]] level to 43 to use [[Protect from Melee]]. Since the Ruins slowly restore your prayer, you can use this prayer permanently without draining your prayer points. Simply bring a weapon (for example [[Silverlight]]) and an [[amulet of strength]] or [[amulet of power]], and bring nothing else to maximize your damage in combat while not having to risk losing items to a [[PKer]].\n\nAlternatively, bring a [[weapon]] and [[monk's robe top]], [[monk's robe bottom]] and a [[holy symbol]], which allows you to use either [[Superhuman Strength]] or [[Improved Reflexes]] in combination with Protect from Melee without draining many prayer points, for a 10% [[Strength]] or accuracy boost.\n\n===Members===\nThere are a number of [[safespots]] which players using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] may use:\n* [[Brimhaven Dungeon]]: standing at the easternmost piece of land in their spawn area or behind the fungus next to the stairs.\n* [[Catacombs of Kourend]]: under the arch which divides the Greater Demon area, and at the extreme northeast corner of the dungeon behind the rope exit.\n* [[Chasm of Fire]]: behind the many pillars and narrow pathways.\n* [[Entrana Dungeon]]: behind the burnt corpses (use the second square south of the stalagmite and two squares away from the sitting burnt corpse).\n* [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]]: at the entrance of the Greater Demon chamber.\n\n==Level 92, 100, 101 and 113 drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value|Greater demon#Level 92|mobname=greater

They are found within the {{TL}}[[Catacombs of Kourend]] and the [[Iorwerth Dungeon]].\n\nLike normal nechryael, Greater Nechryael can summon up to two [[Death spawn]] when fighting a player. These Death spawn are the same as the ones summoned by normal nechryael. Using [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended, as the Greater Nechryael is more accurate and deals even more damage. [[Arclight]] can be very effective against Greater Nechryael, as these are considered to be [[demons|demonic creatures]].\n\nUnlike the [[twisted banshee]], [[mutated bloodveld]], [[deviant spectre]] and [[warped jelly|warped jellies]], who have corresponding superior creatures, Greater Nechryael do not. They simply get the normal [[nechryarch]] instead, although its drop table corresponds to that of Greater Nechryael.\n\n==Strategy==\nMuch like [[Dust devil]]s, Greater Nechryael in the Catacombs of Kourend are popularly killed using [[Ice Burst]] or [[Ice Barrage]], as you are able to clump them up into a pile and hit them all simultaneously. To do this, turn on [[Protect from Melee]], then attack the nechryael in the chamber they're in with a fast ranged weapon (such as cheap [[darts]] or [[knives]]) or the special attack of the [[Dinh's bulwark]] to get them aggressive towards you. Run to a side of the room which has two corners adjacent to each other and run back and forth between the two corners so that the nechryael pile on top of each other.\n\nDue to their very low [[Magic]] defence, it's important to use equipment that maximises Magic damage instead of accuracy, such as a [[tormented bracelet]] or an [[occult necklace]]. Otherwise, wear items that give [[Prayer]] bonus to increase the usefulness of your [[prayer potion]]s. Bringing along [[runes]] to cast [[Blood Burst]]/[[Blood Barrage|Barrage]] can also help extend your trips due to the fact that the summoned [[Death spawn]]s can hit through your prayer. You can be healed up to full in as little as two casts if the nechryael are stacked, making it much more effective than bringing food. Bringing along a [[super defence potion]] or sipping a dose before leaving the bank will help to take less damage.\n\nWhen bursting or barraging, it is recommended to pay some attention in case of [[Nechryarch]] spawns, as it is likely that players automatically attack it and its [[chaotic death spawn]]s deal high damage through magic based gear. Some options to deal with it include switching to [[Blood Barrage]]\u00a0to outheal the damage taken (provided that there are more regular Nechryael next to it), using ice spells to safespot it, or running away when the spawns appear to lose their aggression and coming back.\n\nIf not planning to burst/barrage Greater Nechryael, it's recommended to go to the [[Iorwerth Dungeon]] instead if the player has completed [[Song of the Elves]], as players '''can''' use a [[dwarf multicannon]] to kill Greater Nechryael there.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=534942}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Greater Nechryael}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic air staff|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=23|Rarity=12/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=20|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=50|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=150|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=25|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|7/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|7/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|5/128|override=There is a 5/128 chance of rolling the [[rare seed drop table]].

They are found in various locations within the\u00a0[[Wilderness]] as well as in the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]. Green dragons are capable of breathing [[dragonfire]], which can hit up to 50 damage on players who are not wielding an\u00a0[[Anti-dragon shield]] or [[Dragonfire shield]]. Using one of these shields will partially block the dragonfire, and using one of these shields with an [[antifire potion]] will block the dragonfire completely.\n\nGreen dragons are assignable as a [[Slayer task]] by [[Vannaka]] and [[Krystilia]]. If players wish to avoid the [[risks]] of the Wilderness when assigned green dragons as a Slayer task, they can kill [[baby green dragon]]s within the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]] or green dragons in the [[Myths' Guild]] basement. If players want to challenge themselves, [[brutal green dragon]]s in the [[Ancient Cavern]] can be killed as an alternative. Two green dragons are fought during [[Dragon Slayer 2]].\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' Green dragon hunters are frequently targeted by [[player-killer]]s. If opting to kill green dragons in the Wilderness, an emergency [[teleport]], high healing [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s are highly recommended in the event that you are attacked by another player.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]\u00a0(2 spawns, requires completion of\u00a0[[Dragon Slayer II]])\n*[[Wilderness]]:\n**West of the [[Dark Warriors' Fortress]], between level 12 and

All guards are not [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]] unless they are attacked first. In [[Deadman mode]], there are unique level 1337 guards who are able to hit up to 30 with a very high accuracy ([[melee]] and [[Ice Barrage]]). They are capable of [[Tele Block]]ing and negating [[Prayer]] completely. These guards will kill anyone who enters a safe zone with a [[Skull (status)|PK skull]] instantly. The [[combat level]] is a reference to leetspeak.\n\nGuards can be pickpocketed at level 40 [[Thieving]], giving 46.5 [[experience]].\n\nGuards are also a popular [[clue scroll]] drop monster due to their low level and ability to drop [[Clue scroll (medium)|medium clue scrolls]].

Their melee [[Weapons|weaponry]] consists mostly of [[bronze sword]]s and [[bronze battleaxe]]s. Some guards wield [[bow]]s and wear [[Hardleather body|hardleather bodies]].\n\nThe guards of [[Ardougne]] wield a [[steel mace]], [[steel chainbody]], and a helmet that looks like a [[spiny helmet]] without spikes. They also wear red trousers and blue shirts under their chainmail.\n\nGuards in [[Varrock]] wear unique armour and weapons that resemble that of a [[Renegade knight]].\n\nGuards should not be confused with [[Al-Kharid warrior]]s in the [[Al Kharid Palace|Emir's Palace]], [[Soldier (Yanille)|Soldiers]] and [[Watchman (Yanille)|Watchmen]] in [[Yanille]], [[Kourend guard]]s in [[Great Kourend]], guards found at the entrance of the [[Burthorpe Castle]], or the aggressive [[jail guard]]s found in [[Draynor Village]].\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron bolts|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=2-12|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel arrow|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze arrow|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=6|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel arrow|Quantity=5|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable|18/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable2|18/128|21|f2p=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1|Rarity=19/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=7|Rarity=16/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Namenotes={{(f)}}|Quantity=5|Rarity=18/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only drops in [[free-to-play]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=12|Rarity=9/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=4|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=25|Rarity=4/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=17|Rarity=4/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=30|Rarity=2/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Body talisman|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The body talisman's drop rate decreases to 4/128 while in a [[members]] world.</ref>|AltRarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grain|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Key (medium)|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The key is only dropped when completing a medium clue scroll asking the player to kill an Ardougne knight.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (medium)|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The medium clue scroll's drop rate changes to 1/106 if the medium [[Falador Diary]] has been completed.

Additionally, less time is spent running when slaying Prifddinas Guards as pairs of guards are stationed close together - and wander a small open space - at each of the four main [[Prifddinas]] entrances.

The average of the testing was a clue 1/88 pickpockets with 12 clues tested.)\n\nThe guards in the store room will give a [[Bronze key (H.A.M.)|Bronze]], [[Iron key (H.A.M.)|Iron]], [[Silver key (H.A.M.)|Silver]], or [[Steel key (H.A.M.)|Steel]] key, randomly, while pickpocketing them.

If you stand in the corner two squares due west of the ladder and then attack with Ranged or Magic a H.A.M Guard that is not due east of you, the guard will come up to the square diagonally south-east of you and cannot reach you.

Reducing requirements tends not to be popular.}}\n\nHarpie Bug Swarms should be an easy task for well-equipped mid-level players; their abundance as well as the fact that they remain aggressive to players until level 93 combat makes this task very click-easy. As Harpie Bug Swarms are ''very'' accurate, and will often hit for up to 6 [[hitpoints]], it is advisable to have [[Defence]] levels from 40-50+ and to bring [[food]] appropriate for the player's level, such as [[lobster]]s. Another option for those that have completed [[Tai Bwo Wannai Trio]] is to keep [[Protect from Melee]] up and recharge prayer at the [[Tribal Statue]] about 30 seconds away.\n\nIt is recommended to bring [[nature rune]]s while slaying this monster since it has many drops that can be [[High Level Alchemy|alched]] to free up [[inventory]] spaces, and [[fire rune]]s are frequently dropped from this monster.\n\nThere are two [[safespot]]s: one behind a bush and in between two trees to the south, and another to the north on the beaches of the fairy ring (DKP). Players can setup a cannon to range or melee 2+ swarms to the west, but will need runes to [[telegrab]] any desired drops.\n\nYou can use a [[Dwarf multicannon|Dwarf Multicannon]] in this location, but you have to equip the bug lantern for the cannon to deal damage.\n\n==Locations==\nHarpie bug swarms are located on the northern shore of mainland [[Karamja]], north-east of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] and east of the [[jogre]] dungeon.\n\n'''Notice:''' The map pointing out where the swarm is on the right sidebar.\n\n*(Most recommended) The closest [[fairy ring]] is {{Fairycode|dkp}}. Although you will need to run south and use the [[shortcut]] to cross the river and then run north. Fairy ring {{Fairycode|ckr}} can also be used, though it's further to the south. Taking the former requires you to run past [[the Shaikahan]] and [[aggressive]] [[jogre]]s before you can [[melee]] the swarms.\n*A [[Tai bwo wannai teleport]] scroll will take you to the nearby village, just south-west of the swarms.\n*You can also use the Ardougne cloak's teleport to the monastery, run north-east to [[Captain Barnaby]], take the boat to [[Brimhaven]] and run south and east to reach the swarms.\n*If your [[House]] is in [[Brimhaven]], you can [[Teleport to House]], then walk south to the mainland then east.\n*You can also use a [[ring of dueling]] and take the [[Al Kharid]] [[gnome glider]] to the crashed Karamja one which is slightly slower than the fairy rings.\n*With 53 [[Agility]], 21 [[Strength]], 42 [[Ranged]], and any [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] and a [[mithril grapple]], use the Karamja teleport option on a charged [[amulet of glory]], run southwest, and use the grapple agility shortcut.

Hellhounds are an excellent source of [[Clue scroll (hard)|hard clue scrolls]], as they drop them more frequently than other monsters. If players are on a Hellhound Task and they want to make some money off it, they could choose to kill [[Vet'ion]] as his Hellhound spawns will count towards your task and you may also receive some generous drops from the boss. Killing [[Cerberus]] will also count towards your Hellhounds Task.\n\n==Strategy==\nEven though they are demonic in nature, [[demonbane weapons]] do not work against them. As their [[combat level]] suggests, hellhounds are not easy to defeat. It's worth noting, however, that their high combat level is mostly reflective of their accurate and powerful attacks; hellhounds have low defensive stats. Players with a low [[Defence]] level should bring the best [[armour]] that they can afford as well as high healing [[food]].\n\nAs they only attack with [[Melee]], the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer can be used to nullify their attacks. The most effective yet AFK-able way to use this strategy is at the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], as the area is a [[multi-combat zone]]. Players who have completed at least easy tasks of the [[Ardougne Diary]] can teleport to [[Kandarin Monastery]] to recharge [[Prayer points]], and teleport back via [[Xeric's talisman]]'s Xeric's Heart option (requires full completion of [[Architectural Alliance]]) or the [[Kourend Castle Teleport]] spell (requires 69 [[Magic]] and reading [[Transportation incantations]] to unlock the spell). Alternatively, a [[player-owned house]] [[altar]] and Kourend portal may be used. Bring prayer-boosting armour such as the [[Proselyte armour]] for longer trips and some food just in case you run out of Prayer points and get hit by the hellhounds. Additionally, having a [[bonecrusher]] in your inventory is beneficial as burying bones inside the Catacombs of Kourend also restores Prayer points. When using a high-level strength oriented melee equipment set with proselyte armour and a [[bonecrusher necklace]], players can expect to complete a standard size slayer task in only two or three trips to an altar, making this a highly effective method.\n\nPrayer \"flicking\" can dramatically reduce the cost of fighting them; however, this requires close attention and probably some food to correct mistakes.

In order to fight it, players must first plant a [[Hespori seed]] in the Hespori patch within the west wing of the [[Farming Guild]], which requires level 65 [[Farming]] to access (boostable) and 60% [[Hosidius]] favour. It takes 22-32 hours to grow, depending on when it was planted. When fully grown, the flower behind the cave entrance will sprout open.\n\nAccording to [[Arno]], the Hespori is a rare carnivorous plant originating from [[Morytania]], becoming conscious and highly aggressive once fully grown. The Hespori's appearance is also extremely similar to that of [[The Maiden of Sugadinti]], and it has been confirmed that there is a possible link between the two{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1084257292709711872|date=13 January 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/L7F6g|archivedate=28 April 2020|quote=[The Hespori bears a striking resemblance to the Maiden from TOB. It's also a plant from Morytania. Is there a possible link between the two?] Yes :)}}.\n\nKilling the Hespori allows it to be harvested, which grants 12,600 (12,915 with full [[Farmer's outfit]]) Farming [[experience]], as well as [[seeds]], including [[white lily seed|white lily]] and [[anima seed]]s, which can only be obtained from the Hespori.\n\n==Fight overview==\n[[File:Fighting Hespori.png|left|thumb|220px|A player battles the Hespori.]]\n[[File:Hespori dead.png|left|thumb|220px|A defeated Hespori.]]\nThere are four [[flower]] buds surrounding the patch. The flowers will open up three times during the fight: once upon starting, again after the Hespori reaches below 66% of its health, and a final time after it reaches below 33% of its health. They have 10 hitpoints each and always die in one hit. The Hespori cannot be attacked while any of them are open, so you must subdue all of them before the Hespori can be harmed.\n\nThe Hespori can attack with both magic and ranged. The magic attack's animation looks like the Hespori is twirling around, and can hit up to 14, while the ranged attack has the Hespori swinging its arms and throwing green spores at the player, and can hit twice for up to 8 each time. Protection prayers will not completely negate the damage, but will greatly reduce it.\n\nThe Hespori will sometimes bind you with roots similar to the [[entangle]] spell, rendering you unable to move or attack. When you are rooted, click repeatedly on the floor, preferably the square next to you, or on the Hespori to try and struggle free until you can move and attack again. The chatbox will notify you when you become entangled and when you free yourself. If you don't free yourself in time, the vines will break on their own and hit you for a maximum of over 40 damage. The Hespori can also [[poison]] you, so bringing an [[antipoison]] or better (or simply drinking a dose before the fight) is recommended.\n\nOnce the Hespori is defeated, players must clear the patch with a [[spade]] in order to obtain their loot. Players may leave the lair after this point and come back without having to do the fight again.\n\n===Setup===\nThe best [[melee]] setup consists of armour, generally [[Barrows equipment]] or [[Bandos armour]] with high ranged defence and high strength bonus, with a good [[slash]] weapon, such as a [[dragon scimitar]] or [[abyssal whip]], at high melee stats (60+ recommended). [[Protect from Magic]] should be activated as this is your lowest defence, not ranged.<!-- Protect from Ranged setup is not as effective as the Protect from Magic setup. You will need to eat a lot more food with Protect from Ranged on. --> Alternatively, a setup high in both ranged and magic defence can be sufficient, but you will be eating a lot more food this way, as the Hespori will attack you with both combat styles. Eight pieces of [[food]]\u2014[[monkfish]] or better - will suffice, along with an [[antipoison]], [[spade]], and a [[prayer potion]]. Note that a  [[Ring of Recoil]] does not appear to have any effect against the Hespori. To speed up the kills, you can bring a ([[Super combat potion|super]]) [[combat potion]]/[[super set]] and/or use melee-boosting prayers like [[Piety]]. It's recommended to bring a ranged weapon, like cheap [[darts]], to easily kill the [[flower]]s, as they always die in one hit.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=60326}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Hespori}}\nThe player will have one roll on each of the two drop tables: [[anima seed]]s and normal seeds.

These dungeons may be accessed through the entrance located in the house north-east of [[Barbarian Village]] and west of the [[Cooks' Guild]] if the player has a [[Brass key]]. The Edgeville Dungeon area is usually very crowded in [[free-to-play]] worlds, as players like to gather [[Big bones]] to bury them for [[Prayer]] [[experience]]. [[Members]] worlds usually are much less crowded due to the better [[Money making guide|money making]] options for members. There are two Hill Giants present in level 17-18 [[Wilderness]]; however, very few people go there because of the dangerous [[player killing|player killers]] in the area and its far distance from any bank. The closest bank for most Hill Giants in the Wilderness is in [[Edgeville]]. They are [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]] to players below combat level 57.\n\nThey have relatively low [[Defence]] for their level, which makes them quite good for experience from level 30 to level 50.\n\nThe Hill Giant is one of the creatures that could potentially drop a [[Champion's scroll]], making it a desirable monster both to train on for experience, due to its relatively high [[Hitpoints]] but low [[Defence]], and for its respective scroll.\n\nKilling Hill Giants found within the [[Catacombs of Kourend]] is one of the fastest ways to farm for [[Ancient shard]]s and [[Dark totem]] pieces because of their low [[Hitpoints]], allowing high level players to kill upwards of a couple hundred an hour.\n\nIt can drop the [[giant key]], which is required to fight the hill giant boss [[Obor]].\n\n==Locations==\n===Free-to-play===\n*[[Edgeville Dungeon]] (13)\n*East of [[Al Kharid]] (1)\n*[[Wilderness]]:\n**South-east of the [[Black salamander]] [[Hunter]] area (2)\n**[[Lava Maze]]\n\n===Members===\n*South-west of [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]\u00a0(slightly\u00a0north-west of the well)\u00a0(6)\n*[[Taverley Dungeon]] (5)\n*North of the [[Observatory]] (6)\n*[[Tree Gnome Village (location)|Tree Gnome Village]] (2)\n*[[Catacombs of Kourend]]\n*North-west of the [[Graveyard of Heroes]] (12)\n*[[Deep Wilderness Dungeon]]\n\n==Money making==\nFor low-levelled players, Hill Giants can be a great way to make money as they always drop [[big bones]], which are {{Coins|{{GEP|Big bones}}}} coins each. The major and most noticeable drawback for free-to-play players is that the [[Edgeville Dungeon]] is often crowded. \n\n[[Limpwurt root|Limpwurt roots]] are another low-level, free-to-play money-making method, though they have a lower drop rate.\n\nFor free-to-play players with a high Defence (~65+), a good way to save run energy while killing Hill Giants is to only equip [[dragonhide armour]]. The relatively lower weight will allow you to run further without exhausting your energy, and your Defence will be high enough to negate a large amount of potential damage.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Hill Giant}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron arrow|Quantity=3|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel arrow|Quantity=10|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mind rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=6|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|7/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|7/128|f2p=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable|18/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable2|18/128|28|f2p=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n''The overall chance of rolling a coin drop is 65/128 in [[Free-to-play]] and 40/128 for [[members]] with an average value of {{Coins|24}} and {{Coins|35}} respectively.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Namenotes={{(f)}}|Quantity=5|Rarity=18/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"d\" name=\"f2\"/>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=38|Rarity=14/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=52|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=15|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Namenotes={{(f)}}|Quantity=10|Rarity=7/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"d\" name=\"f2\">Only dropped in [[Free-to-play]]</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=88|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Beer|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Body talisman|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Giant key|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref>The drop rate is doubled in the [[Wilderness]]</ref>|AltRarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n<references/>\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|3/128|chaostalisman=yes|naturetalisman=yes|f2p=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Looting bags are only dropped by those found in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled giant head|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/25}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (beginner)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/50|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Giant champion scroll|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Catacombs tertiary===\n{{CatacombsDropTable|combat=28|hitpoints=35|catacombsonly=yes|f2p=yes}}\n\n===Twisted League tertiary===\n''The drops below are only available during the [[Twisted League]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|28}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n=== Wilderness Slayer tertiary ===\n{{WildernessSlayerDropTable|combat=28|hitpoints=35|versionname=Level 28}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=30 April 2020|update=Poll 70 and Bounty Hunter Changes|change=[[Krystilia]] can now assign [[bloodveld]]s, hill giants, [[moss giant]]s, [[black knight]]s, [[pirate]]s and [[zombie]]s as a [[Slayer]] task.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*They were once just called 'Giants', but this was later changed by [[Jagex]] to avoid confusion between other [[giant]]s.\n*They are one of three kinds of giants available in free-to-play worlds, the other two being [[Moss giant]]s and [[Ice giant]]s.\n*Some Hill Giants appear to be wielding [[cleaver]]s, weapons from the [[Recipe for Disaster]] quest.\n*Despite being called \"Hill Giants\", the majority of the giants are found in [[dungeon]]s.

A player must kill all 5 of the hopeless creatures in order for the [[Bridge of Hope]] to appear. Each monster must be slain a total of 3 times before they will truly die. Each time a form is killed, they will retreat from the player and shrink in size. It should be noted that every time a player eats, 75% of the monster's current health is restored. These monsters can attack with ranged during the quest, but usually use melee to attack. When poisoned, hopeless creatures do ''NOT'' carry the [[poison]] on to their next forms.\n\nAfter the quest, hopeless creatures can be killed as a means to train combat. As the monsters have low [[defence]] and high health, it can prove to be a fruitful method of training. Additionally, the surrounding area is rarely occupied, meaning the spawns will have little competition. One downfall however, is that these monsters do not drop anything upon death. A [[rope]] will be needed when entering the dungeon for the first time.\n\n{{A Soul's Bane}}\n[[Category:Monsters with multiple forms]]",

They were created by a [[Dragonkin]] named [[Karuulm]] as a project which is not based on any prior work done by his fellow kin.\n\nHydras are only assigned as a [[Slayer task]] by [[Konar]]. There are two areas within the dungeon that contain hydras, one being exclusive to players on a hydra Slayer assignment. As both of these are located within the Karuulm Slayer Dungeon, players who have not completed the [[elite Kourend & Kebos Diary]] must wear [[boots of stone]], [[boots of brimstone]], or [[granite boots]] to protect themselves from the extreme heat of the dungeon floor, or else they will take rapid damage.\n\nKilling a Hydra is a requirement for the [[Kourend & Kebos Diary|elite Kourend & Kebos Diary.]] The [[Alchemical Hydra]] boss is task-only, but the standard Hydras found on the lower level of [[Mount Karuulm]] are not, so the achievement can be boosted using a [[Wild pie]] or other temporary skill boost.\n\n==Fighting==\n[[File:Hydra poison splats.png|thumb|left|250px|The poison splats launched by the Hydra.]]\nHydras start off with a random combat style at the start of the battle, switching after three attacks, regardless if they hit or not. If the hydra still persists after roughly 30 seconds into a fight, it will spit poison at three random tiles (one at the player's location, two elsewhere), dealing 4 poison damage every two ticks (or 1 to 2 damage if the player has [[poison]] immunity) when the player is standing on one. The initial splat has a 3x3 AoE.\n\nHydras can drop their [[Hydra's eye|eyes]], [[Hydra's fang|fangs]], and [[Hydra's heart|hearts]], which are used to create the [[brimstone ring]].

In order to dispel the ice storm, the braziers surrounding it must be lit, and [[Kindling (Chambers of Xeric)|kindling]] fuels them. There are plenty of trees outside the chamber it resides in to chop for tinder. Having a deposit chest built will greatly help for managing inventory space. Alternatively, players may drop some of their items and pick them up later, although it is recommended to only drop expendable items in the event the raid instance is closed (through a disconnection, for example).\n\nKindling is obtained through chopping trees in the corridor preceding ice demon. The amount of kindling received per swing is determined by the player's [[Woodcutting]] level, with every 12 levels granting the ability to receive another kindling: at level 1 Woodcutting, only one kindling can be received per swing, and at level 96 Woodcutting or higher, one to eight kindling can be received per swing.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Bruno|url=https://twitter.com/JagexBruno/status/1101073823355621376|date=28 February 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/QTzkk|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Breakdown of how your Woodcutting level affects the amount of kindling and XP received.}} The [[experience]]\u00a0gained from chopping scales to the amount of kindling chopped.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!{{SCP|Woodcutting}}\u00a0level\n!Maximum kindling\n!Experience gained\n|-\n|1\n|1\n|30\n|-\n|24\n|2\n|45\n|-\n|36\n|3\n|55\n|-\n|48\n|4\n|62.5\n|-\n|60\n|5\n|68.5\n|-\n|72\n|6\n|73.5\n|-\n|84\n|7\n|77.75\n|-\n|96\n|8\n|81.5\n|}\n\nThere are four braziers surrounding the demon. An [[icefiend]] occupies each brazier (one icefiend for each player in the team, capping at four icefiends). They do not move, but they will extinguish any lit fires near them. The more wood is burning, the faster the ice storm is dispelled.\n\nOnce the ice storm is dispelled, the icefiends will disappear and it will start attacking players. It has two attacks; a snow boulder and Ice Burst. The demon will take overhead prayers into account when fighting them; if the target is using [[Protect from Missiles]], it will only use the snow boulder attack. If [[Protect from Magic]] is used instead, it will only use Ice Burst. Both attacks are AoE with a 3x3 radius, so one can avoid attacks completely by moving a few spaces away from their spot.\n\nThe demon has low health compared to other monster puzzles, but compensates for this with high Defence and a damage reduction effect.\n\nThough the demon has damage reduction effects for both range and melee attack styles reducing damage to 33%, damage from fire spells and [[flames of Zamorak]] are both increased to 150%{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1133350436554121216|date=28 May 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/3Iew0|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Increased to 150% for a fire spell, decreased to 33% otherwise.}} and is fairly accurate due to its magic defence being calculated from its defence level rather than magic, unlike most monsters.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1101198072300875778|date=28 February 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4KTxH|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Most NPCs calculate magical defence from the Magic stat.

Ice giants have two separate variants where they appear to be holding different weapons; a [[longsword]] or a [[warhammer]]. These monsters can be commonly assigned by the [[Slayer master]] [[Vannaka]].\n\nThe ones located at the ground level of the [[White Wolf Mountain]] are rather tricky to reach. To reach them, mine the boulder located west of the [[Ice warrior]]s (requires 50 [[Mining]]) and climb down the southernmost ladder, then take the south-west path leading to another ladder, then climb up. Once you come up the ladder, the first two can be safespotted by the trees. Alternatively, you can use a [[Weapons#Ranged weapons|ranged weapon]] to hit them from the mountain path, but this puts you at risk of being hit by the wolves (something to take into account if you're a low level).\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Asgarnian Ice Dungeon]]\n*[[White Wolf Mountain]] (above and underground)\n*{{TL}}[[Settlement Ruins]]\n*[[Wilderness]]:\n**[[Revenant Caves]] (level 67)\n**[[Frozen

She can be found in the [[Ice Queen's lair|caverns]] beneath [[White Wolf Mountain]].\n\nShe only drops the [[ice gloves]], this is a quest item used in the [[Heroes' Quest]], and also optionally in several other quests, notably [[Recipe for Disaster]] ([[Flambeed]]), and [[Desert Treasure]] ([[Fareed]]). It's possible to obtain ice gloves without having started the quest.\n\nShe cannot be accessed without 50 [[Mining]] (boostable).\n\n==How to get to her==\n[[File:Heroes' Quest - Rockslide.png|alt=Location of the rockslide|left|thumb|Compass pointing north; location of the rockslide to get into the lair.]]\n[[File:Heroes' Quest - Ice Queen's lair route.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Ice Queen's Lair]].]]\nGo to White Wolf Mountain by the northernmost entrance to the [[White Wolf Mountain|mountain]] (from either [[Catherby]], [[Taverley]] or take the [[gnome glider]] there) and go north until you come to a rock slide. Use a [[pickaxe]] on the rock slide and go through it (this requires 50 [[Mining]]) to the [[Ice Queen's Lair]]. Once you are through, you will be near level 57 [[ice warrior]]s and three ladders.\n\nUse the southern ladder and go down the southwestern tunnel. Go up the ladder just after the tunnel bends north. Once you go up, you will see level 53 [[ice giant]]s there. Take the eastern ladder down. Go north through the long tunnel with level 61 [[ice spider]]s and ice giants (the spiders in the tunnel do not show up on [[minimap]]). The tunnel makes a loop and ends at a ladder. Go up the ladder, then go down the other. Continue down the tunnel until it opens up into a large room full of ice warriors and the Ice Queen. Kill her and she will drop the ice gloves.\n\nSafespotting: If you stand behind the throne, you can avoid the ice warriors and can still attack the Ice Queen if positioned right.\n\n'''Warning: her lair is a [[multicombat area]] and she is surrounded\u00a0by level 57\u00a0[[ice warrior]]s\u00a0who will attack you.'''\n\n==Fighting her==\n*She has a weakness towards [[magic]] so it is recommended you use this if you have a decent [[Magic]] level.\n*She is not immune to poison - so this can be used as a way to drain her health if you are otherwise struggling to damage her - see below for a hiding spot to heal and wait for poison to do damage.\n*There are areas of her cave where she and her minions cannot walk, limited by their patrol range - these areas (behind clumped icicles pointing up from the ground) can be very useful to take a break to eat some food, and can even be used to [[safespot]] the queen if used correctly.\n*An example of this is shown in the images below - to the eastern side there is a clump of icicles, behind which the ice queen and warriors cannot reach. Use this spot to heal up, and also it can be used to [[Ranged|range]] or mage her for the safety of this spot. You may have to 'hit-and-run' to lure her closer to the spot - firing at her then running closer to the spot until she is within firing range of it - from which you may chip away at her to your heart's content.\n[[File:Ice Queen safespot.png|thumb|none|300px|Player safespots Ice Queen]]\n\n*As a skiller, it is possible to obtain the Ice Gloves with the help of a friend or an alt account with mid level hitpoints (70+).\n\n1. Load the friend with enough [[Ring of Recoil]]s (she has 105 hp, so 3 minimum) and food to tank some hits.\n\n2. The skiller should bring 1 or 2 extra rings, plenty of food as well to drop for their friend and a good amount of iron knives or a bow, or something to attack with. The skiller will need to deal 1 damage to the Ice Queen.\n\n3. Have the friend cast [[curse]] or any other non-damaging spell on the Ice Queen so that they draw aggro.\n\n4. Let the friend recoil her down a few hitpoints before the skiller starts attempting to deal the required 1 damage to her. (If the skiller does the first point of damage, she might regenerate it and the damage won't count.)\n\n5. After the skiller does a single point of damage and is still dropping food for their friend, just allow the friend to recoil the Ice Queen til she dies. The [[Ice Gloves]] will be rewarded to the skiller if done correctly!\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ice gloves|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Freeing the Mountain Dwarf}}\n{{Heroes' Quest}}\n{{White Wolf Mountain}}",

However, the shield doesn't affect the accuracy of the attacks. Their accuracy seem to neglect all defence bonuses from stats and equipment; hence, they almost always are able to deal some damage. Despite possessing melee stats, ice troll females do not make use of it.\n\nIce troll females are located in four places. They are firstly, in the [[Jatizso]] mines. Next, they are found amongst hordes of other trolls on the northern isle. They also found in the northern isle cave systems (the eastern cave before [[The Fremennik Isles]], and the western cave after).\n\nThe ice troll female drop table is somewhat unusual, in that it varies depending on the exact version of monster being killed.

[[Yak-hide armour]] reduces the troll's maximum hit and therefore is recommended over armour with higher defensive bonuses for players who do not pray.\n\n\n==Habitat==\nTheir main habitats are the islands north of [[Jatizso]] and [[Neitiznot]], where the trolls congregate. The island immediately north of Neitiznot can be an effective training area if one uses the [[Honour guard]]s that are always fighting the trolls to assist them.\n\nThe grunts' other location is the northern cave systems (the eastern cave before completion of [[The Fremennik Isles]], and the western cave after). This cave has many Ice Trolls including [[Ice troll female|females]] and [[Ice troll male|males]].\n\n==Drops (variant 1)==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=2280172}}\n\nThis version is found throughout the area north of Neitiznot and Jatizso.\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Granite shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=8-14|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=12-36|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=4-12|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=4-8|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|2/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable|11/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{UncommonSeedDropTable2|11/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=200|Rarity=20/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw shark|Quantity=2-8 (noted)|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seaweed|Quantity=3-9 (noted)|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ball of wool|Quantity=18-42 (noted)|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|naturetalisman=yes|chaostalisman=yes|version=Variant 2}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 1}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled troll head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/20}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Drops (quest area)==\nThis version is found only in the western portion of the [[Ice Troll Caves]].\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 2}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead|version=Variant 2}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Trolls}}",

He is located on the northern part of the isles in [[Ice Troll Caves|his lair]]. He uses all three [[Combat style]]s, which includes a [[Melee]] attack, a [[Magic]] attack that freezes players, and a [[Ranged]] in which he will throw rocks at players and a [[special]] move, which will send players flying across the battleground.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe main thing to be careful about is his [[special attack]] that knocks players backwards. Players should use the [[Protect from Magic]] or [[Protect from Missiles]] [[prayer]]. [[Protect from Melee]] will result in the Troll King knocking the player into the cave wall for very high damage, which will repeat mutiple times, leaving them almost helpless; when players use either of the other prayers, it negates his attack, which knocks you back. Equip the [[Fremennik round shield]] (created during the quest). This, combined with the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer, should keep damage taken to a minimum as the shield will lower his [[Ranged Strength]] and he will not hit you for more than 1 or 2 [[Hitpoints]] with each hit. A one-handed [[Dragon equipment|dragon weapon]] or better is advised to defeat the King as he has high defensive stats.\n\nAnother way of defeating him is to simply use a [[Ring of recoil]] and to stand well away from him. This will cause him to use Ranged attacks dealing small amounts of damage to you and him. This method uses a lot of food and may still result in death if you are unlucky.\n\nAnother strategy is to use the Protect from Missiles prayer. If this prayer is used, the Troll King can only use magical and close-range (melee) attacks, and players can negate his attack, which knocks them backwards. However, he can still freeze players with his magical attack, which can be highly annoying and a waste of Prayer, and Protect from Missiles has a higher Prayer requirement. Bear in mind also that the damage taken from the Magic attack is not reduced nearly as much by equipment, if at all. For these reasons, Protect from Magic is generally recommended.\n\nAfter the Ice Troll King is dead, decapitate him and take the [[Decapitated head (The Fremennik Isles)|head]] to the [[Mawnis Burowgar|Burgher]] to show you have defeated him.\n\nFor further detail on this and other parts of the quest, see [[The Fremennik Isles]] quest guide.\n*'''Note:''' The King has a Magic attack similar to [[Ice Barrage]]; however, players can use Prayer to protect themselves.\n\n{{Trolls}}\n{{The Fremennik Isles}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

They hit harder than their combat level suggests and also have the ability to hit through armour, similar to [[Verac the Defiled]]. [[Yak-hide armour]] '''DOES NOT''' reduce the troll's maximum hit. It is advised to use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer whenever engaging more than one at a time. Ice troll runts are often found near [[Ice troll female]]s; when they're not, they will be spread farther out.\n\nIce troll runts are found on the northern isle with the rest of the ice trolls, and in the cave systems (the eastern cave before completion of [[The Fremennik Isles]], and the western cave after). They're also found south of the bridge to the troll isle just north-west of [[Neitiznot]]. In this location, they tend to engage in combat with the [[Honour guard]]s just east of the bridge. While they prefer to attack the guards, they will attack a player if the player is their first target, until they grow tolerant of the player.\n\nPlayers can get a drop with at least one [[successful hit]], letting the guards do the rest of the work. This tactic can be used effectively with [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]], to stay out of the way of hits.\n\nThis is an excellent choice for training [[Slayer]] if a player has received a troll task, as they have better drops than their [[Mountain troll]] counterparts and the player can complete the task more quickly and safely since they are constantly fighting with the guards. However, if a guard deals the finishing blow or attacks a runt as it dies in the same [[RuneScape Clock|tick]] as the player, the Slayer experience gained will be halved.\n\nThe ice troll runt drop table is somewhat unusual, in that it varies depending on the exact version of monster being killed.

Food such as [[Swordfish]] or better is advised. Wearing [[Adamant armour|adamant]] or [[Rune armour]] will be a good option, as the warrior's melee attacks will be less effective. Ice warriors are weak against fire spells and crush weapons. There is a 20% chance for your attack to ignore 10% of the ice warrior's magic defence. When this happens you get the red game message: \"Your attack ignored 10% of your opponent's magic defence.\"\n\nIn the [[Asgarnian Ice Dungeon]], they can be [[safespot]]ted by trapping an ice warrior on one side of a plus shaped formation of rocks near the entrance into the next part of the dungeon.\n\nAt the [[White Wolf Mountain]] they can be safespotted directly south of the dungeon marker, or in the ladder area (1 step west of middle ladder or east of tree. Switch to another warrior if they pull you from your spot).

They have four arms, and are quite adept in using these to pummel their enemies into submission, while some prefer to hurl large icicles at adventurers. Pescaling Pax intends to use these as a strike force when they do invade the mainland.\n\nIcelords are encountered during the [[Cold War]] quest. They are in a cage on the Penguin's Iceberg that is explored during the quest. After the quest is finished, they can be accessed by entering \"A Crack\" again, and re-entering the cage.\n\nInside the Cage, there are three Icelords that use [[melee]], and one wielding icicles that uses [[ranged]]. They are weak to [[magic]] attacks, so it is recommended to use the best magic spell available to the player, or [[Dragon weapons]].\n\nThe main reason for making the trip back to fight them is because they can be used as a replacement for [[Ice warrior]]s during a [[Slayer task]]. They provide one more experience compared to Ice warriors. They also have an \"advantage\" of most of the time having only one drop, [[Big bones]] (they also drop [[Long bone]]s rarely), negating the need for [[bank]]ing, therefore allowing them to be killed en masse. It is recommended that lower-levelled players (and most other players) bring a half-inventory of [[cake]]s, as these creatures do not hit hard or frequently, but it will add up as time goes on. This allows for greater numbers to be killed.\n\nKilling an icelord will award you with a bonus 40 [[Attack]] experience.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Cold War}}",

Players who plan on fighting them should be wary of their accurate magic attack.\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\nInfernal Mages use a weaker version of the spell [[Fire Blast]]\u00a0to attack the player, so it is recommended to wear [[dragonhide]]\u00a0or [[Armour/Magic armour|magic armour]], which will reduce their chance to hit. Wearing [[Void Knight equipment|Void Knight armour]] is a good option because of its high magic defence. The [[Protect from Magic]] prayer is recommended for lower levels, as these mages can hit often. [[Prayer#Prayer Flicking|Prayer flicking]] is an effective strategy to minimize their damage output. Due to their focus on using magic, they are weak to both melee and ranged attacks. They cannot be safespotted, but it is possible to safely hit-and-run them with ranged (with or without long-ranged depending on the weapon used), or by luring a mage into the south-eastern corridor and then hiding in the south-eastern most alcove of the tower.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Morytania]] [[Slayer Tower]] ({{FloorNumber|2}})\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=31289}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Infernal Mage}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic boots (dark)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|Drop Rates V2}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic hat (dark)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes={{CiteForum|author=Envision|url=https://archive.fo/5P5mn|title=Drop Rates V2|name=Drop Rates V2}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Staves===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff of fire|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Lava battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Elemental runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=36|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Catalytic runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mind rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Body rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=18/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n''The overall chance of rolling a coin drop is 44/128 with an average value of {{Coins|4}}.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1|Rarity=19/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=2|Rarity=14/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=4|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=29|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Infernal Mages appear to be wielding a version of the [[Slayer's staff]], along with a set of green, decaying [[mystic robes]].\n*They appear to be casting [[Fire Blast]], however their max hit suggests they are actually casting [[Fire Strike]].\n*Due to their high accuracy, damaging magic attacks, and lack of consistent valuable [[drops]], players often skip Infernal Mage [[Slayer task|tasks]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}",

Although they are the second weakest of the six, it is especially dangerous to kill them, as with all metal dragons, due to their ability to shoot\u00a0long-range [[dragonfire]]. A\u00a0[[dragonfire shield]], or an\u00a0[[anti-dragon shield]],\u00a0coupled\u00a0with an\u00a0[[antifire potion]]\u00a0is necessary for full dragonfire protection. Having only one form of protection will result in some dragonfire damage being inflicted onto the player. Using an anti-dragon shield and the [[Protect from Magic]] [[prayer]] will not fully protect the player. A [[super antifire potion]] or extended equivalent provides complete protection from dragonfire without the need for prayer or shield.\n\n[[Magic]] or [[Ranged]] is a common method of killing these creatures since they will not attempt to close in the distance to [[Melee]], thus rendering the character invulnerable as long as they keep their dragonfire protection (with both\u00a0an antifire potion '''AND''' an\u00a0anti-dragon shield). Melee users are recommended to use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer, as they can hit very hard. Their [[Defence]] is also high, so Ranged (with ranged-boosting prayers/[[potions]]), Magic, or a [[stabbing weapon]] like the [[Zamorakian hasta]] are effective in taking them out.\n\nWith the completion of the\u00a0[[Elite Karamja Diary]], iron dragons killed in [[Brimhaven Dungeon]] will have their [[iron bar]]s noted.\n\nIf they are fought without complete dragonfire protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use [[Protect from Melee]] to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Brimhaven Dungeon]]\n**The task-only area contains eight more iron dragons, which can only be killed while on a [[Slayer task]].\n*{{TL}}[[Catacombs of Kourend]]\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron bar|Quantity=5|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>[[Iron bar]]s are dropped in [[bank note]] form if players have completed the [[Elite Karamja Diary]] and are killing iron dragons in the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1024|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dragon>The drop rate is 1/1,024 for a specific legging, or 1/512 for any leggings.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1024|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dragon />}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dart(p)|Quantity=9|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune knife|Quantity=5|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune javelin|Quantity=4|Rarity=20/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=19/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant bolts|Quantity=2-12|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=270|Rarity=20/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=550|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=990|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super strength(1)|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite limbs|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite bar|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curry|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Rare and Gem drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|2/128|3/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|189}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>[[Brimstone key]]s are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|AltRarity={{Brimstone rarity|215}}|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Catacombs tertiary===\n{{CatacombsDropTable|hitpoints=195|catacombsonly=yes|versionname=Catacombs of Kourend}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/256|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dmm>The drop rate is 1/256 for a specific dragon legging, or 1/128 for any dragon legging.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/256|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dmm />|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n{{Dragon}}\n{{Brimhaven Dungeon}}",

They give 75 Slayer experience per kill and drop [[hard clue scroll]]s and [[steel weapon]]ry.\n\nThese monsters attack with a [[magic-based melee]] attack; therefore it is recommended that players wear high [[magic defence]] armour, such as [[dragonhide]]. However, [[Protect from Melee]] will prevent all damage from them. Players may [[Pray Flick]] if the cost of prayer potions seems too high.\n\nThey can be [[safespot]]ted from behind the stones in the hallway south of the Jelly chamber. It is also possible to [[safespot]] by standing on the corner of the rocks in the western section of the chamber and the northern rock pile which the Jellies will not wander away from.\n\n==Strategy==\n*Due to the relative simplicity of killing jellies, it is not important to note any particular strategy. Be advised that on the north wall, near the hallway you enter the room from, there is a safespot. The safespot is notoriously frustrating to utilise due to the jelly's unusual route mechanic. [[Melee armour|Metallic armours]] and other armours with low magic defence are not advised due to jellies' magic-based melee attack; dragonhide is an excellent stand-in for rune armour.\n*It is a good idea to bring high-level alchemy spells for the drops.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=237836}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Jelly}}\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/686843730532372480|date=12 January 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/kLOea|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=It's 1/128, so that's quite unlucky.}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n''The overall chance of rolling a coin drop is 88/128 with an average value of {{Coins|96}}.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=102|Rarity=39/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=44|Rarity=30/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=220|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=11|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=460|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=15|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Thread|Quantity=10|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|4/128|chaostalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteForum|author=Envision|url=https://archive.fo/5P5mn|title=Drop Rates V2|name=drop}}|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|78|bonus=yes}}|Raritynotes=<ref group='d'>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The examine text, \"There is always room for jelly,\" is a reference to the {{wp|Jell-O}} advertising slogan, \"There's always room for Jell-O.\"\n*Jellies' drops are similar to the drops from a [[Greater demon]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n{{Fremennik Slayer Dungeon}}",

Jubblies are not particularly hard to hunt. They do not actually attack players and only run a few squares away when they get too close to them. A good spot to hunt them is just to the east of the [[gnome glider]], southeast of the [[Castle Wars]] arena, in the [[Feldip Hills]]. Once they are killed, they must be plucked to receive the drops.

It is among the strongest [[demons]] in the game. It uses extremely strong [[magic]] attacks and, when in range, a [[halberd]]-like [[melee]] attack. It is possible to let the [[gnome]]s around it take it to about 10 hitpoints, while you are hiding across the bridge at the edge of [[banana plantation (Ape Atoll)|the arena]]. Afterwards, you can run out to quickly finish it off. However, if the gnomes \"kill\" the demon, it will restore 20% of its hitpoints, so you cannot fully rely on the [[10th Squad]] to kill it.\n\nLike all demons, it is susceptible to the effects of [[demonbane weapons]].\n\nIt can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Attacks==\nThe Jungle Demon alternates between all four [[blast spells]] for its magic attacks, and its melee attack is like a halberd (which means that it can hit two tiles away). Both types of attacks can hit up to 32 damage.\n\n==Recommended equipment==\nThe recommended equipment to bring when fighting the Jungle Demon would probably be 2-3 four dose [[prayer potion]]s depending on your [[Prayer]] level (37 for [[Protect from Magic]] makes the fight considerably easier). Without Protect from Magic, a high magic defence and lots of food may be required. The rest of your inventory should have [[monkfish]] or better, as well as magic or ranging equipment, depending on your method of attack.\n\n==Strategy==\nThe easiest way to kill the Jungle Demon is to hide at the edge of the arena, waiting until the gnomes get him down to about 10 hitpoints. Afterwards, you can run out and finish it quickly. The Jungle Demon will regenerate to 20% of its full health if you do not deal the final blow.\n\nFor those without 37 Prayer, the above method is highly recommended. Be sure to equip high magic defence gear and farcast it using [[Ranged]] or Magic spells. Alternatively, a [[dragon dagger]] [[special attack]] can be used four times in a row, which is very likely to knock it out as well.\n\nThose with 37 Prayer can simply attack the Jungle Demon from a distance by either using Ranged or Magic spells while using the Protect from Magic prayer.\n\nUsing a [[dwarf multicannon]], fewer than twenty (20) [[cannonballs]] may be used, making the cannon the most effective way to kill the demon.\n\nAlthough most demons are very weak to Magic, the Jungle Demon has a high magic level and high magic defence, so using Magic against it is not recommended.\n\nDue to the demon attacking with both Magic and melee at close range, it is not recommended to use melee. Doing so would prohibit you from praying against all damage. If melee is however your only option, be sure to use a [[Stab weapons|stab]] or [[crush weapon]] whilst praying protect from Magic, as the Jungle Demon has high [[slash]] defence.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you kill the demon as it kills you (or if you kill it using [[Retribution]]), the kill will count and you will still be able to finish the quest.\n*The demon is currently the only one of its kind; however, its examine text implies that there may be more of its kind, including lesser jungle demons.\n\n{{Monkey Madness I}}\n{{Ape Atoll}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Demons}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

If they do not move, the attack will drag the player forward into [[melee]] range and bind them in place, where his sword is able to attack every 3 ticks (1.8 seconds). His melee attacks hit much harder than his regular [[magic]] attacks, so moving out of the way of the shock wave attack is recommended to prevent this from happening.\n\nZachariah can only be harmed by the [[Saradomin Strike]] spell.

To gain access to his chamber, players must have slain 40 Zamorakians throughout the dungeon. He uses [[melee]] and [[magic]] attacks, and can occasionally negate the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer should players attempt to use it.\n\nHe is typically killed on a [[Slayer task]]; K'ril Tsutsaroth is classified as a [[greater demon]]; thus, killing him counts towards any greater demon Slayer task and thus allows a player to take advantage of the abilities of a [[Black mask]] or [[Slayer helmet]]. As a demon, he is also susceptible to [[Arclight]]'s passive effect.\n\nK'ril is the least popular of all of the [[God Wars]] bosses, as his unique drops (namely the [[Zamorak hilt]]) do not have as much value compared to the other generals. A trip is also more tedious; his [[prayer]] smashes can quickly drain a tanking player's supplies and players cannot use [[bones to peaches]] tabs to extend their trip as he and his bodyguards all drop ashes.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|K'ril Tsutsaroth/Strategies}}\n[[File:Fighting K'ril Tsutsaroth.png|thumb|300px|A group of players fighting K'ril Tsutsaroth and his bodyguards.]]\nLike other God Wars Dungeon bosses, K'ril roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight.

The Kalphite Queen, along with [[dust devil]]s and [[smoke devil]]s, is notable for dropping the\u00a0[[Dragon chainbody]].\nThe Kalphite Queen can inflict large amounts of damage with her [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks as they always result in a [[successful hit]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/606032495704801281|date=3 June 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/raBDO|archivedate=26 May 2020}} It is recommended for players to bring an emergency teleport such as an [[Ectophial]] or [[teleport tablet]], or only bring items into the [[Kalphite Lair|lair]] for which they are willing to pay the gravestone fees.\n\n==Location==\nThe Kalphite Queen resides in her [[Kalphite Lair|lair]] south-west of the [[Shantay Pass]]. If you are lucky and fast, you can run from the Shantay Pass to the Kalphite Lair fast enough so that the [[desert heat]] does not affect you. Alternatively, the [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|BIQ}} can take you to right outside the Lair entrance. You will require a [[rope]] to enter the dungeon, which will be used in the process. A second rope is required to reach the lower level where Kalphite Queen resides. Completion of [[Desert Diary]] removes the need to bring ropes each time.\n\nIn addition, those with access to [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] can find a tunnel in the [[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon]] that leads through to the Kalphite Lair, emerging near the [[Kalphite worker]]s.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Kalphite Queen/Strategies}}\n[[File:Fighting Kalphite Queen.png|thumb|250px|A player fights the airborne form of the Kalphite Queen.]]\nThe Kalphite Queen has a [[combat level]] of 333. Each form has 255 [[Hitpoints]], and her [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks have 100% accuracy. She may also use a decently accurate [[melee]] attack. The Queen has two forms: in the first, she is an immense scarab beetle, and in her second, a giant wasp. She switches forms only after the first has been fully defeated.\n\nAs a beetle, she is extremely resistant to Magic and Ranged attacks, as indicated by her overhead [[prayers]]. As a wasp, she is resistant to Melee attacks. Therefore, players should be prepared to use both Melee and Ranged or Magic.\n\nEach of her attacks have a max hit of 31. Her Ranged attacks consists of her shooting barbed spines from her abdomen. Her Ranged attacks will drain 1 prayer point. When wearing a [[spectral spirit shield]], there is a 50% chance a Range attack will drain a prayer point. If there are players close to the person being targeted with this attack they will also be hit, to avoid this players can stand on opposite sides of the Kalphite Queen. Her Magic attack bounces from player to player. Her Melee attack can also hit high, but is much less accurate than the Magic and Ranged attacks.\n\n==Drops==\n''The player will always receive two items from the Kalphite Queen's drop table: One from the regular drop table, and one from the Consumables table.''\n\n{{DropLogProject|kills=27711}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:KQunique|{{#expr:\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon chainbody}} +\n(1/256) * 1 *

[[File:Protect from magic and missiles overhead.png]]\n*The Kalphite Queen's original drops were much worse, similar to the [[King Black Dragon]]'s before their drop tables were updated due to player feedback.\n*Prior to a poll, only the second form counted towards the damage needed to obtain drops after her death. This upset players as crashers would come when a player was on the second form, taking the drop from them with minimal effort. This has since been changed, and now players who did the most damage to '''both''' forms will obtain the drop.\n*If the second form stays alive for a long period of time, it will revert back to the first form and retain the second form's remaining [[Hitpoints]]. When the first form is killed again, a second form with full health will emerge, akin to [[Vet'ion]].\n*If stat-draining [[special attacks]] are used on her first form, the stat reductions will carry over to the second form.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/861503532712722432|date=8 May 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Ck9G5|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=Yes [when the defence is lowered on KQ's first form it stays lowered on the second form], same with Vet'ion.}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[King Black Dragon]]|title=[[Strongest monster|Strongest monster in ''RuneScape'']]|successor=[[TzTok-Jad]]}}\n\n{{Kalphite}}\n{{Rulers}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Monsters with multiple forms]]\n[[Category:Monsters that do not become tolerant]]",

They guard the entrance to the lair of the [[Kalphite Queen]]. These are highly dangerous because of their ability to [[poison]] starting at 4 damage without dealing melee damage, and they inhabit a [[multi-combat area]].\n\nA player can choose to hunt these for [[Slayer]] when given the task to kill [[Kalphites]]. When given this task, a player can choose to kill any of the Kalphite family ([[Kalphite Worker|Workers]], Soldiers, [[Kalphite Guardian|Guardians]] or the [[Kalphite Queen|Queen]]). Killing Kalphite Soldiers will grant 90 Slayer XP per kill.

He uses [[Ice spells]] that will freeze the player. He resides in a freezing environment which will constantly lower the player's stats, providing an additional threat when fighting him.\n\nKamil makes a reappearance in the [[Recipe for Disaster]] final battle as [[Karamel]].\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Ice Path map.png|150px|thumb|left]]\nKamil is reached east of the [[Ice Path]], north of [[Trollheim]].\n\nFirst go north-west of Trollheim (the easiest way to get there is by [[Trollheim Teleport]], which requires 61 [[Magic]] and completion of [[Eadgar's Ruse]]) and walk to the Ice Gate. Squeeze between the gate, kill five [[ice troll]]s to get the cave to open. Enter the cave and head up the Ice Path, past the [[ice wolf|ice wolves]] and there will be a clearing. Kamil will soon appear when the player walks a few steps past a boulder.\n\n==Strategy==\nSince Kamil hits higher with [[melee]], it is advised to use [[Protect from Melee]] and wear armour that defends well against [[Magic]]. Note that Kamil's Magic attack is very accurate and the icy environment will constantly lower the player's stats which also means their Magic resistance is lowered each time, so it may be a good idea to assume most of Kamil's Magic attacks will be a [[successful hit]] and the player maximises their offensive bonuses. '''Kamil is immune to spells other than [[Fire spells]]; this immunity includes [[Iban Blast]], [[Trident of the seas]]/[[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] and [[Flames of Zamorak]].'''\n\nWhenever Kamil casts his magic attack, he will encase the player in ice for a short time. During this time, all actions, including eating and teleporting, are blocked. Also note that, if Kamil is not in melee range, he will use his magic attack much more often, effectively keeping the player stunned for the majority of the fight. Therefore, it is in the player's best interest to lure Kamil to melee range by hiding behind the first boulder encountered in his arena. When you have been stunned by his magic attack, be sure to time your attacks within one game tick before the ice breaks. This will ensure that your character successfully attacks the instant the ice breaks.\n\n[[Super restore]]s or [[Prayer potion]]s and [[restore potion]]s are advised to counter the freezing environment and in order to restore [[Prayer]].\n\nIf using Magic, [[Ahrim the Blighted's equipment|Ahrim's robes]], [[Lunar equipment|Lunar robes]], [[Splitbark armour]], or [[Mystic robe]]s are a good choice. Players should not use a Fire spell if their Magic level is around the level to cast it, as they will constantly need to drink restore potions; instead they should pick a lower-level Fire spell, an effective countermeasure to the freezing environment which constantly lowers stats. Players who have completed [[Family Crest]] may wish to take advantage of the [[chaos gauntlets]] which will raise the max hit of [[Fire Bolt]] to 15. Using Ranged is also effective against Kamil.\n\nKamil is also considered an [[ice warrior]] in regards to [[Slayer task]]s, so if the player has ice warriors as their current task a [[Black mask (i)]] or equivalent would provide a damage bonus against him.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chocolate cake|Quantity=1,2|Quantitynotes=<ref group=d>Two cakes are dropped when fought during [[Desert Treasure]] while one cake is dropped when fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]]</ref>|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super restore(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only dropped when fought during [[Desert Treasure]]</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kamil (\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644) is an Arabic word and name that means \"complete\".\n*Killing Kamil counts toward your Slayer Task if your current monsters are Ice Warriors. \n\n{{Desert Treasure}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

If you fight her in [[Nightmare Zone]], turn on protect from magic and leave it on. Karamel will teleport next to you and start using melee until protect from magic is turned off.\n\n==Fighting Karamel==\nAs soon as the battle begins, run up to her and use a crush weapon or fire spells. Remember to use one that's far below your magic level because her spells can lower [[Skill|stats]], as well as reducing a player's [[special attack]] bar to 0, so [[stat restore potion]]s are highly recommended. While fighting, she will freeze the player and [[Teleportation|teleport]] away from the player, so patience (as well as a one click teleport) is advised.\n\nIf you are a low level player, DO NOT underestimate her magic attacks, as they can hit rapid 7s. The best way to avoid damage is to run up in front of her, so she can use her very inaccurate melee-range Ranged attack as well.\n\n'''Note''': the player '''cannot''' use [[Prayer]] in this boss fight or any other [[Recipe for Disaster]] boss fight.\n\n'''Note:''' Although spells such as [[Iban Blast]] do not work on Kamil, they can be very effective versus Karamel.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Choc-ice|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Recipe for Disaster}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Also unlike a player using [[Karil the Tainted's equipment|his equipment]], he is also fairly weak to [[Magic]] attacks. Karil's set effect is '''Tainted Shot''', which gives him a 25% chance per [[successful hit]] to lower the player's [[Agility]] by 20%.\n\nHis set effect does not pose a threat in combat however his attacks are very accurate even on players with high defensive bonuses, so players may find it difficult navigating to the chest later with a lower Agility level (and as a result, less [[energy]]). As such, it is strongly recommended to activate [[Protect from Ranged]] - note that this does not prevent his set effect from activating. The use of a [[super restore]] potion may be worth using after the fight if the player's Agility stat has been drained significantly.\n\nKaril's weakness is melee (in particular stab and slash) so the use of an [[abyssal whip]], [[godsword]] or [[Zamorakian hasta]] is advised. He does have a moderate amount of melee defence, so players may prefer to use Magic instead - [[trident of the swamp]]/[[Trident of the seas|seas]], [[Iban Blast]] or [[Magic Dart]] are common.\n\n==Drops==\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|98}}|Raritynotes=<ref>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Karil's unconventional weakness to [[Magic]] is because he has a low Magic level.

Level 37 Slayer and completion of [[Ernest the Chicken]] are required to kill them. Players are suggested to wear [[insulated boots]] when fighting killerwatts - not wearing them will result in taking increased damage from the killerwatt's [[Ranged]] attacks due to lightning strikes; however, this damage can still be negated with [[Protect from Missiles]]. A [[Dwarf multicannon]] cannot be set up in the killerwatt plane.\n\nKillerwatts are a commonly skipped Slayer task on account of their high damage output compared to their combat level, and the resulting expense of supplies not being offset by their drops.\n\n==Strategy==\nKillerwatts are much more dangerous than what their [[combat level]] may suggest; both their [[Ranged]] and [[Melee]] attacks will hit players every 1.2 seconds, much faster than the speed of an [[Abyssal whip]] or [[scimitar]]s, and their melee attacks are exceptionally accurate, although [[Prayer flicking]] is still possible despite their attack speed. Using Ranged or [[Magic]] from across clouds will limit them to their Ranged attack, allowing players with [[protection prayers]] to safely complete this [[Slayer task]]. Their Ranged attack is magic based, and thus equipment with high Magic Defence such as [[dragonhide armour]] will provide the best protection against the Ranged attack. Contrary to popular belief, their melee attack is NOT magic based, and as such your best melee armour is most effective when using the 'baiting' method (where the player selects to attack the enemy but clicks away before landing their first attack, leading to the killerwatt only using melee attacks).\n\nKillerwatts initially appear as floating balls of electricity, but will grow limbs if attacked. Though they aren't aggressive, they will '''immediately''' retaliate after being clicked on, and will try to get within melee range of the player before attacking. Because of this, it is possible to stop a killerwatt from using Ranged attacks entirely by clicking on it with a Melee weapon equipped and then waiting for it to attack first. A killerwatt that has targeted a player will not stop following them until they log out or leave the killerwatt plane.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=63929}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Killerwatt}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff of fire|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff of air|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic fire staff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=3/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=17|Rarity=2/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=5/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=45|Rarity=8/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=8|Rarity=11/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=37|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=9/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steam rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=2/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cannonball|Quantity=3|Rarity=2/140}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|35/140}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|35/140}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=11|Rarity=23/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=44|Rarity=28/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=76|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=127|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=200|Rarity=11/140}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire orb|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soda ash|Quantity=4|Rarity=1/140}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|5/140|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The name is a play on \"{{Wp|Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt}}\", a unit of power, with the word \"killer\" included to imply their hostility, or that they may give a deadly amount of watts.\n*During [[Enlightened Journey]], and while unlocking routes for the [[Balloon transport system]], some killerwatts can be seen standing on top of clouds, trees, rocks and buildings.

The King Black Dragon can also be killed as an alternative for a [[black dragon]] [[Slayer task]].\n\nAlthough he will always fight back when attacked, he has gotten bored over the centuries from adventurers attacking him as he revealed to his good friend, [[Bob the Cat]].\n\nWhile the King Black Dragon's lair is entered from within the Wilderness, his lair itself is not part of the Wilderness, so players cannot attack each other in his lair. Completion of the [[Wilderness Diary]] also '''does not''' note his bone drops, and the KBD '''does not''' count towards a black dragon slayer assignment given by [[Krystilia]].\n\nPlayers can pay 50,000 coins from their inventory to open an [[instanced]] version of the KBD lair (right-click ''Private'' option on lever), where it will be inaccessible by other players.\n\nThe King Black Dragon's [[respawn]] time is 8 seconds.\n\n==Reaching the King Black Dragon==\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' As the entrance to the [[King Black Dragon Lair]] (aka '''KBD Lair''') is located in the [[Wilderness]], '''watch out for player killers!'''\n[[File:KBD Routes.png|thumb|left|280px|The routes that lead up to the KBD Lair.]]\n*The [[burning amulet]] can be used to get to the KBD Lair fast. It teleports the player to the [[Lava Maze]] just south-east of the fenced area containing the entrance. This is the most reliable way to get there, running west and going down the ladder in the [[lesser demon]] cage.\n\n*[[Wilderness Obelisk]]s can also be used to get there. Be wary that using them makes the player more susceptible to encountering high-level monsters or [[player killers]]. Players who complete the hard [[Wilderness Diary]] can choose the obelisk they wish to teleport to, namely the obelisk closest to the KBD's lair at level 44 Wilderness. The nearest obelisk can be accessed if the player teleports to the [[Corporeal Beast]] area via a [[games necklace]], exits the cave, and runs south-east to the obelisk and then south-east again to reach the KBD Lair.\n\n*From [[Edgeville]], players can bring an [[axe]] to make a [[Waka canoe]], which requires 57 [[Woodcutting]], at the canoe station and take it to the [[Wilderness]]. Upon arrival, the player will have to trek westward past some [[green dragon]]s on the southern end of the Lava Maze before going slightly north-west toward the western part of the Lava Maze where some fenced lesser demons are. Players entering their cage will find a ladder that will lead down to some aggressive [[poison spider]]s where a lever is pulled to finally arrive at the KBD's lair.\n\n*North-west of [[Ardougne Castle]], there's a lever that can be pulled that takes the player to [[Deserted Keep]]. From there, the player needs to slash some spider webs to get out, and head southward to a long fence and follow it either east or west to an opening. If following it east, beware of the [[Chaos Elemental]]! Once out, trek westward past the northern end of the Lava Maze before going slightly south-west toward the western part of the Lava Maze where some fenced lesser demons are. Enter their cage, and there's a ladder that will take you down to some aggressive poison spiders where a lever is pulled to finally arrive at the KBD's lair.\n\n*The [[Ice Plateau Teleport|Ice Plateau]] or [[Ghorrock Teleport]] is among the fastest ways to get there. After teleporting, the player should run south-west to the gate opening, and run south-east to some fenced lesser demons on the west side of Lava Maze. Enter the cage, and there's a ladder that goes down to some aggressive poison spiders where a lever is pulled to finally arrive at the KBD's lair.\n*The [[Arceuus spellbook]]'s teleportation spell, [[Cemetery Teleport]], can be used to get to the KBD lair. It teleports players to the [[Forgotten Cemetery]], just south of the KBD lair.\n\n==The battle==\n{{Main|King Black Dragon/Strategies}}\n[[File:Fighting the King Black Dragon.png|thumb|280px|A group of players take on the King Black Dragon.]]\nIn addition to his damaging attacks, the King Black Dragon can also [[poison]] the player and reduce the player's [[stats]]. It is strongly recommended to bring [[anti-poison]] ([[Antidote++]] is preferred) and stat-restoring potions such as [[Super restore]]s.\n\nHis normal [[dragonfire]] is significantly stronger than normal dragonfire, with a max hit of 65 with no protection, 15 with the [[Anti-dragon shield]] or [[Dragonfire shield]], and is completely blocked with both the shield and [[Antifire potion]]. Because the max damage is so high, the player should always have one of these shields equipped.\n\nIn addition to his regular dragonfire, the King Black Dragon has three unblockable breath attacks: Poison, Shock, and Freeze. Although an antifire potion reduces damage from these attacks by 75%, it will only nullify all damage from the regular dragonfire. With the anti-dragon shield or equivalent equipped, they only deal up to 10 damage. [[Protect from Magic]] does '''not''' protect against or reduce damage of dragonfire when an anti-dragon shield or equivalent is equipped.\n\n==Treasure Trails==\nKilling the King Black Dragon for a [[key (elite)|key]] to open the closed chest in the north-east corner of his lair is the solution to an elite [[cryptic clue]]: ''Scattered coins and gems fill the floor. The chest you seek is in the north east.''\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black dragonhide|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1500}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=300|Rarity=5/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>If [[Monkey Madness II]] has not been completed, the drop rate of fire runes are 10/128.</ref>|AltRarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=300|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron arrow|Quantity=690|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bolts|Quantity=10-20|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Resources===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Yew logs|Quantity=150 (noted)|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite bar|Quantity=3|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold ore|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Amulet of power|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon arrowtips|Quantity=5-14|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon dart tip|Quantity=5-14|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon javelin heads|Quantity=15|Rarity=5/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Dragon javelin heads are only dropped after completion of [[Monkey Madness II]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite limbs|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Shark|Quantity=4|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Rare and Gem drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|8/128|2/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Key (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The key is only dropped when completing an elite clue scroll asking you to kill the King Black Dragon.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|276}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped while on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Kbd heads|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/450|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Prince black dragon|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/750|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1250|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nKing Black Dragon artwork.jpg|A group of players fighting the King Black Dragon as depicted in art.\nA Tail of Two Cats - Bob talking to KBD.png|Bob talking to the King Black Dragon.\nA Tail of Two Cats - R4ng3rNo0b889 dying.png|R4ng3rno0b889 is killed by the King Black Dragon.\n</gallery>\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=17 October 2019|update=Bounty Hunter Rework Beta|change=King Black Dragon boss tasks are no longer offered to players until they've started Dragon Slayer and gained access to anti-dragon equipment.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=4 January 2018|update=Dragon Slayer II|change=The examine text was changed.

His residence is within [[Varrock Palace]], where the [[Varrock Palace Secret Guard]] work to keep him safe. He is located in the south-east side of the Palace on the ground floor. He is notable for being one of the least controversial kings, as he is a very straightforward, stable ruler. He has a wife, [[Ellamaria]], who rules alongside as queen.\n\n==Treasure Trails==\n{{Anagram|King Roald|medium|LARK IN DOG}}. The answer to his challenge is '''24'''.\n\n==History==\nKing Roald is the son of [[King Roald II]], a monarch most famous for his efforts to reclaim the Shield of [[Arrav]] from the [[Phoenix Gang]] and [[Black Arm Gang]]. Although little is currently known of King Roald's early history, he is known to have had a pampered upbringing, learning to read from the Palace's librarian, [[Reldo]].\n\nSince his rise to the position of king, Roald III has been accepted by most as a generally good ruler. Under his rule, the city of [[Varrock]] has prospered greatly, and has seen the renovation of the [[Varrock Museum]] and the establishing of the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\nYet, despite this, there are certain groups that feel Roald is weak in the face of the Church of [[Saradomin]], and others that would go so far as to see him assassinated. His hesitance in matters such as the recent conflicts with [[Morytania]] have earned him many enemies.\n\n==Quests==\n===Shield of Arrav===\nDuring the [[Shield of Arrav]] quest, players must visit King Roald to collect a reward for returning the Shield of Arrav to the [[Varrock Museum]]. Originally, King Roald had no role in the quest, but an update gave him a small part in the quest's ending, paying the reward to the player for returning the shield.\n\n===Priest in Peril===\nYou can start the [[Priest in Peril]] quest by speaking to King Roald.\n\n===What Lies Below===\nDuring the [[What Lies Below]] [[quest]], he falls under a mind control spell cast by [[Surok Magis]] and is forced to fight against the player. He is level 47 and can only be defeated if the player summons [[Zaff]] when he is at zero [[Hitpoints]]. He is immune to damage from the [[Vengeance]] spell, [[recoil ring]]s and [[poison]].\n\n===Dragon Slayer II===\nIn the culmination of [[Dragon Slayer II]], players seek his aid at the behest of [[Jardric]] and [[Bob (cat)|Bob]]. He sends a quite large number of soldiers to help in the battle against the [[Dragonkin]] [[Zorgoth]].\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref>Only in the [[Nightmare Zone]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n<references/>\n\n==Dialogue==\n{{Hastranscript|npc}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[RuneScape Classic]], King Roald's name was simply ''King'' and examine stated he was ''King Roald the VIII''.\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[Monarch|King]] [[Roald II]]|title='''[[Monarch|King]] of [[Misthalin]]'''|successor=}}\n\n{{Shield of Arrav}}\n{{Priest in Peril}}\n{{Garden of Tranquillity}}\n{{What Lies Below}}\n{{Darkness of Hallowvale}}\n{{Dragon Slayer II}}\n{{Varrock}}\n{{Rulers}}\n[[Category:Saradominists]]",

One is also found in the courtyard of the East [[Ardougne Castle]]. Most are found attempting to chase away thieves. They will protect all stalls from the [[silk stall]] and up by attacking players that they observe stealing from them.\n\nKnights of Ardougne can be pickpocketed at level 55 [[Thieving]], giving the [[player]] a [[coin pouch]] worth 50 coins and 84.3 Thieving [[experience]]. The [[gloves of silence]] or the medium [[Ardougne diary]] increase success rate by 5% and 10%, respectively. Failing to pickpocket will result in being hit for 3 points of damage. They are a good source of [[Thieving]] experience, with ~3,000 pickpockets possible in an hour.\n\nThe chance of a successful pickpocket is ~60% at level 55 and ~94% at level 99, linearly increasing with each level. With the medium Ardougne Diary completed, this increases to ~67% and 100%, respectively.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1054078453811761153|date=21 October 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/OdIaw|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=Correct. So for the knights the default would be 50/255 at level 1 and 240/255 at level 99, interpolating between those. And if you had the diary bonus, it'd be 55/255 - 264/255 (where anything 255/255 or above is 100%). I don't know exactly how the engine rounds it up/down.|name=k}} With the diary bonus, players stop failing altogether at level 95, and at around level 90 the damage becomes sustainable with [[regen bracelet]] and [[Hitpoints cape]]/[[Rapid Heal]].\n\nA common training method is to lure a knight to the north-east house in ardougne market (east of the Silk Stall) and repeatedly pickpocket the knight. This method only works by luring the south-east most knight in the market to the north-east house, then shutting the door. The knight will only move between the 2 southernmost tiles in the house. The player can then set NPC attack options to \"Hidden\" (under the \"Controls\" panel in the \"Settings\" tab) and repeatedly left-click on the knight. By positioning the camera correctly, it is possible to repeatedly click the exact same spot without moving the mouse before opening the [[coin pouch]]es. The knight ''must'' be able to move freely between the southern two tiles, or he will despawn. You can also simply hop worlds until you find a world where the knight has already been lured. '''World 378''' is the unofficial world. Toggling your run off will also prevent the knight from walking through you. \n\nIf pickpocketing the Knights of Ardougne with the full Rogue's set from 55 Thieving to 99 Thieving, one can expect to gain about 15,500,000 coins.\n\nA known bug with a Knight of Ardougne occurs when two people fail to pickpocket at the same time. Doing so will result in the knight temporarily disappearing, or \"flickering\", for 1\u20132 seconds. Some players incorrectly believe that \"flickering\" is caused by players wielding weapons while pick-pocketing, this however is a myth.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Pickpocketing==\n===Success chance===\n[[File:Ardy knights success rate.png|thumb|500px|Success rate of pickpocketing using/having: nothing, gloves of silence, or Ardougne medium diary done.]]\nThe chance of successfully pickpocketing a Knight of Ardougne is <math>\\left(\\frac{1939 * ThievingLevel + 48061}{255000}\\right)</math>.{{NamedRef|k}}\n\nWith the multiplicative +10% pickpocketing bonus from the [[Medium Ardougne Diary]], players will stop failing to pickpocket them at level 95 Thieving.\n\n{{PickPocketTable|Knight of Ardougne}}\n\n===Loot===\nA successful pickpocket attempt will gain the following loot:\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLineThieving|Name=Coins|Quantity=50|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}{{#set:Thieving level=55}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The release of [[Song of the Elves]] made it possible to wear the entire Knight of Ardougne outfit, as both the [[Ardougne knight helm]] and [[Ardougne knight platebody]] are used in the quest.

The player must defeat Koschei three times without dying; although they are told they must defeat him to win, defeating him three times is considered enough to win, as the test is of bravery, not strength.\n\nKoschei's [[combat level]] is not shown; however, he will get progressively stronger and his attacks faster each time he is defeated. His max hits are 3 in his first form, 5 in his second, and 7 in his third. Although the fourth form is difficult, with 255 [[Hitpoints]], it is not impossible to defeat him; if he is defeated, the player will be rewarded with a [[Fremennik blade]].\n\nPlayers can talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] about Koschei's history.\n\n==Strategy==\nA [[ring of recoil]] can be an aid in killing the fourth form. When he hits, he always hits for 1 [[hitpoint]], but at a rate of 3-4 hits per second, and due to the rounding-up of the ring of recoil, would always hit him back for 1 at the same attack rate. Note, however, that a player would have to bring several rings of recoil, because each can only reflect 40 Hitpoints.\n\nLow-levelled players may find his third and fourth form rather difficult, so a [[gnome amulet]] or [[combat bracelet]] is '''strongly''' advised, for it will provide a little protection (do not wear a [[ring of life]], or you will most likely have to start over again if your Hitpoints get too low).\n\nThere are certain [[safespots]] in Koschei's basement, such as the pillars of fire, or the many chasms in the ground. Players need only run quickly over to one side of a hole, and because Koschei only moves at a walking speed, players should be at one end of a hole long before he reaches the other end. '''However, do not stay in a safespot for too long, or Koschei will disappear and you will have to fight him all over again.''' It is also '''strongly''' advised that players bring high-healing food, such as [[monkfish]] or [[sharks]], as in his third and fourth form he hits progressively harder and quicker. Also, it appears that if you take too long fighting Koschei, he will simply disappear and you will have to start the challenge all over again. It is interesting to note that, if you manage kill him three times, decide to try and kill him a fourth time, but find yourself unable to, the trial will still be deemed as a success. Once your Hitpoints reach 1, the player will kneel down and be transported back to Thorvald, who will still give them his vote.\n\nIt '''is''' possible to bring certain weapons into Koschei's chamber. If you bring in a [[dramen branch]] and a [[knife]], you can carve a [[dramen staff]] then and there. If you bring [[crossbow limbs]], [[crossbow stock]], [[crossbow string]], and a [[hammer]], you can fletch a crossbow and then use it to safespot Koschei.\n\nNote that if players die on his first, second, or third form, they will die a normal death and lose their items - players can only die to his fourth form to get the vote.\n\n==Rewards==\n''This reward is only awarded if the player defeats Koschei in battle.''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLineReward|Name=Fremennik blade|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=6 February 2014|update=Quick-prayers & Loot Broadcast|change=After Koschei the Deathless drained your prayer in [[Fremennik Trials]], players could simply restore it and re-activate their prayers.

However, in this legend, Koschei's soul was in a needle, inside an egg, inside a duck, inside a hare, inside an iron chest, which was buried under a green oak tree, which is on the island of Buyan, in the ocean. The only way to defeat him was if the egg or the needle was broken, and in some legends it has to be done on Koschei's forehead.\n*He has a [[Zamorak]] symbol on his chest. However, his relation to the god is unknown. In [[rsw:RuneScape 3|Runescape 3]], however, it is later revealed that he is one of the [[Mahjarrat]].\n*Koschei's name is spelled \u041a\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 (Kosch\u00e9i Bessm\u00e9rtny) in Russia where he is a popular figure in its folklore. As is usual in Russian transliterations, there are numerous other spellings. The spelling in other Slavic languages (like Polish \"Ko\u015bciej\", Czech \"Kost\u011bj\") suggests that his name may be derived from \"kost\" (rus. \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, pol. ko\u015b\u0107, cz. kost = bone); thus suggesting a skeleton-like appearance, which also indicates a possible connection with the Mahjarrat.\n*He is the fastest attacking [[NPC]] in the game (in his final form with an attack speed of 1, meaning every 0.6 seconds), along with [[Scarab swarm]]s. The attack speed for his first three forms is exactly the same as unarmed combat.\n\n{{The Fremennik Trials}}\n{{Dragon Slayer II}}\n{{The Fremennik Exiles}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]\n[[Category:Rellekka]]\n[[Category:Monsters with multiple forms]]",

A [[Ranged]] level of at least 70 is then required to navigate the chasm. To enter the boss room, players must have slain 40 followers of Armadyl, with aviansies and their spiritual variants being his only followers within the dungeon.\n\nKree'arra can be seen yelling several battle cries in his chamber.

He attacks primarily with [[Ranged]], and his bodyguards use a different combat style each. However, if no one is targeting Kree'arra, he will fly up to players to use [[Melee]] attacks as well. If all players leave, his health and stats will be reset.\n\nLike other Armadylian followers, he and his bodyguards cannot be attacked with Melee.\n\n===Bodyguards===\n*[[Flight Kilisa]] ([[Melee]])\n*[[Wingman Skree]] ([[Magic]])\n*[[Flockleader Geerin]] ([[Ranged]])\n\n[[File:Fighting Kree'arra.png|thumb|250px|A group of players fighting Kree'arra and his bodyguards.]]\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=29637}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:kreeUnique|{{#expr:\n(1/381) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl helmet}} +\n(1/381) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl chestplate}} +\n(1/381) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl chainskirt}} +\n(1/508) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl hilt}} +\n(1/762) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 1}} +\n(1/762) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 2}} +\n(1/762) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 3}}\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:onekreeLoot|{{#expr:\n(1/1) * 1 * {{GEP|Big bones}} +\n(1/1) * 8.5 * {{GEP|Feather}} +\n(8/127) * 3 * {{GEP|Ranging potion(3)}} +\n(8/127) * 3 * {{GEP|Super defence(3)}} +\n(8/127) * 5 * {{GEP|Grimy dwarf weed}} +\n(8/127) * 2 * {{GEP|Dwarf weed seed}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Yew seed}} +\n(8/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Black d'hide body}} +\n(8/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune crossbow}} +\n(8/127) * 102.5 * {{GEP|Rune arrow}} +\n(8/127) * 22.5 * {{GEP|Runite bolts}} +\n(8/127) * 7.5 * {{GEP|Dragonstone bolts (e)}} +\n(43.7/127) * 1 * 19750 +\n(8/127) * 593.5 * {{GEP|Mind rune}} +\n(1.25/127) * 1 * 20750 +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Crystal key}} +\n(10/127) * 1 * {{GWDRDTValue}}\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:onekreeminionLoot|{{#expr:\n(1/1) * 1 * {{GEP|Bones}} +\n(1/1) * 6 * {{GEP|Feather}} +\n(1/127) * (1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl helmet}} +\n(1/127) * (1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl chestplate}} +\n(1/127) * (1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Armadyl chainskirt}} +\n(1/127) * (124/127) * 1050 +\n(1/127) * (9/12) * 1050 +\n(1/127) * (1/12) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 1}} +\n(1/127) * (1/12) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 2}} +\n(1/127) * (1/12) * 1 * {{GEP|Godsword shard 3}} +\n(8/127) * 96 * {{GEP|Steel dart}} +\n(8/127) * 12.5 * {{GEP|Smoke rune}} +\n(8/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy kwuarm}} +\n(8/127) * 3 * {{GEP|Mushroom potato}} +\n(8/127) * 2 * {{GEP|Manta ray}} +\n(7/127) * 96 * {{GEP|Steel arrow}} +\n(70/127) * 1050 +\n(7/127) * 2 * {{GEP|Crushed nest}}\n}}}}\n\nThe average Kree'arra kill, including its unique drops, is worth {{Coins|floor({{#var:onekreeLoot}}+{{#var:kreeUnique}})}}.

He is involved in the [[Monkey Madness I]] quest, and players must talk to him before meeting [[King Awowogei]] to make an alliance with him.

They reside in the [[Lava Dragon Isle]] in the [[Wilderness]] (between level 36 and 42 [[Wilderness]]), and attack with [[melee]] as well as with [[dragonfire]]. Due to their low [[magic]] level, they are particularly weak to magic, thus making [[Fire Bolt]]\u00a0a\u00a0slow but profitable method of killing them.\n\nLava dragons can be [[safespotted]] both inside and outside their isle. The many piles of skeletons and edges at the isle allow for players to safespot them inside. Alternatively, players can camp some of the southern spawns outside the isle, although they should be careful as [[Vet'ion]] can walk to their safespot and attack the players. Having 74 [[Agility]] and the hard [[Wilderness Diary]] completed is recommended when killing them to use the stepping stones to escape the isle, as the area is frequented by [[player killers]].\n\nBringing a [[pestle and mortar]] is optional to grind the scales into shards, in addition to [[High Level Alchemy]] runes to alch their common [[adamant equipment|adamant]] and [[rune equipment]] drops.

[[Ice cooler]]s, which can be bought from any [[slayer master]], are required to kill them. The cooler will be consumed, so multiple coolers are necessary for slayer trips.\n\nThey can be killed in place of [[Small Lizard]]s or [[Desert Lizard]]s on a [[slayer task]], and are found within the same area as the desert lizards. They will provide more experience on a task than desert lizards.\n\nPlayers can kill [[Sulphur Lizard|Sulphur Lizards]] as an alternative to Desert Lizards, provided they have the higher Slayer level. However, sulphur lizards do not require [[Ice cooler|ice coolers]] to finish off.\n\n==Locations==\n*They are located in the [[Kharidian Desert]] north of [[Nardah]]. The [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|DLQ}} is the best way to reach them - there are some just north-west of the ring. Another way to get to them is to go through the [[Shantay Pass]], head south-east and cross over the first bridges. The lizards should be just south of the crossing. The lower level [[Small Lizard]]s and [[Desert Lizard]]s are also found in this location.\n\n==Slayer strategy==\nIce coolers must be used on them when they reach low health in order to kill them. If an ice cooler is accidentally used when the desert lizard has more than 4 hitpoints, it will still be used up but have no effect. Ice Coolers are [[Stackable items|stackable]], therefore it's recommended to bring spares. Alternatively, 'Reptile Freezer' can be bought from a slayer master for 90 slayer reward points, which makes your character use ice coolers automatically.\n\n[[Waterskin]]s (and a means of filling them, such as a Knife for cutting cacti or [[Humidify]]) should be brought to avoid dying in the desert due to [[desert heat|heat]]. [[Desert clothing]] may be useful if you can afford to fight without decent armour. [[Magic]] attacks appear to be effective, particularly [[fire spells]], although melee works well enough.\n\nThese Lizards should be killed for the most experience, as they have more hitpoints. There are two that spawn due north-east of the fairy ring, almost at the edge of the map. They are each near a cactus. You can kill the first lizard, slash a cactus with knife, move to the second, kill lizard, slash cactus, repeat as needed. They drop [[big bones]], so more [[experience]] in Slayer, [[combat]], and [[Prayer]] is gained than with the smaller lizards. On the other hand, killing the smaller lizards allows you to complete your task more quickly. A cactus may be used to [[safespot]] a Lizard for Range and Magic attacks.\n\n'''Note:''' Players on a Lizards Slayer task who wish to avoid the Kharidian Desert can kill [[Sulphur Lizard]]s in [[Mount Karuulm]] instead.

Today, long after his exile, they still remain loyal, constantly attempting to invade Great Kourend.\n\nLizardmen can be unlocked as a [[Slayer task]] at a cost of 75 [[Slayer reward points]]. Once unlocked, they can be assigned by [[Chaeldar]], [[Nieve]]/[[Steve]], [[Duradel]] and [[Konar]].

Shayzien soldiers will not attack the shamans (nor will the shamans attack them), since they are busy dealing with a small group of [[lizardmen]]. Below are a couple ways to get there. [[Fairy rings]] are the fastest way to reach them. These three shamans are present in a [[multi-combat area]].\n\nPlayers can check how many players are currently in the western area of the canyon by speaking to the wounded soldier outside the canyon, just south of the broken crossbow.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' The player should be wary if more than one shaman attacks them at a time as they can quickly stack up damage from their abilities and attacks, which can quickly end a trip. If the players do not want to be attacked constantly by the nearby lizardmen and their [[Lizardman brute|brute]] forms, killing the ones in the north and south-west corners is recommended.\n\n====Xeric's talisman====\n#Use [[Xeric's talisman]] to teleport to ''Xeric's Inferno''.\n#Run south through [[Lovakengj]].\n#Once you've reached the south end near some [[giant bat]]s and a house with a [[water source]], head a bit west to reach some patrolling [[Kourend guard]]s.\n#Go south into the [[Lizardman Canyon|canyon]] and down the handholds to the west.\n\n====Fairy rings====\nPartial completion of [[Fairytale II - Cure a Queen]] is required to use the [[fairy rings]]. A fairy ring (code {{Fairycode|DJR}}) is nearby, just south of [[Lizardman Canyon]].\n\n===Lizardman Caves===\n[[File:Lizardman Shaman location 2.png|thumb|From Xeric's Look-Out, follow the blue arrow to reach the shamans.]]\nEight shamans reside inside a cave at the northern end of the [[Lizardman Settlement]] before [[Xeric's Shrine]].

Excluding the spawns, these attacks do not have a cooldown so it is possible for a lizardman shaman to repeatedly use the same ability over and over again.\n\n*A green acidic attack that will deal 25-30 damage. Wearing tiers 1-4 [[Shayzien armour]] will reduce the damage of this attack greatly; wearing a full set of [[Shayzien armour (tier 5)|tier 5 Shayzien armour]] will reduce this damage to 0. This attack can also cause [[poison]] starting at 10 damage.\n**Players who have completed the hard [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]] can talk to [[Captain Cleive]] to be able to wear their [[Slayer helmet]] or [[Slayer helmet (i)]] as a [[Shayzien helm (5)]].\n*A jump attack that targets a small area where the player was previously standing on. If the player is in that landing area when the shaman crashes down, they will be dealt with 20-25 [[typeless]] damage. This jump has a 3x3 AoE (2x2 in the temple, with the player's position as the northeast tile) and is not used if the jump location is obstructed.\n*It may summon several small purple [[Spawn (lizardman shaman)|spawns]] that appear next to the player. After a few seconds, the spawns will explode. The damage dealt is anywhere from 5-10 depending on the player's proximity next to them; their explosion covers a 5x5 area (3x3 area in the temple), or a 2 tile radius from them (1 tile in the temple).\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=292640}}\n{{#vardefine:oneLshamanLoot|{{#expr:\n1 * {{GEP|Big bones}} +\n\n(1/5000) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon warhammer}} +\n\n(9/250) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune med helm}} +\n(8.5/250) * 1 * {{GEP|Earth battlestaff}} +\n(8.5/250) * 1 * {{GEP|Mystic earth staff}} +\n(8/250) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune warhammer}} +\n(6/250) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune chainbody}} +\n(5/250) * 1 *{{GEP|Red d'hide vambraces}} +\n\n(1/20) * 70 * {{GEP|Air rune}} +\n(1/20) * 50 * {{GEP|Chaos rune}} +\n(1/20) * 25 * {{GEP|Death rune}} +\n(1/20) * 70 * {{GEP|Fire rune}} +\n\n(20/250) * 2 * {{GEP|Xerician fabric}} +\n(1/25) * 22.5 * {{GEP|Coal}} +\n(1/25) * 32.5 * {{GEP|Iron ore}} +\n(4/250) * 4 * {{GEP|Runite ore}} +\n\n(1/35.56) * 2.5 * {{GEP|Grimy kwuarm}} +\n(1/44.44) * 2.5 * {{GEP|Grimy cadantine}} +\n(1/44.44) * 2.5 * {{GEP|Grimy dwarf weed}} +\n(1/59.26) * 2.5 * {{GEP|Grimy lantadyme}} +\n\n(5/250) * {{TreeHerbSeedDTValue}} +\n\n(35/250) * 3050 +\n(19/250) * 12 * {{GEP|Lizardman fang}} +\n(15/250) * 2 * {{GEP|Chilli potato}} +\n(3/150) * {{GEP|Wrath talisman}} +\n\n(10/250) * {{RDTValue}}\n}}}}\n\nAn average lizardman shaman kill is worth {{Coins|floor({{#var:oneLshamanLoot}})}}.

The level 98 riders attack using somewhat slow, but strong [[Ranged]] attacks with a max hit of 22. The level 106 version uses a spear for [[melee]] and has a lower max hit of 15, but attacks faster than the rangers. Remember that you need to bring a [[light source]] when you are in the dungeon.\n\nLocust riders are scattered throughout the dungeon. They frequently hit over 20, so [[Prayer#Prayers|Protection Prayers]] and good [[food]] are recommended, especially if multiple riders are encountered.\n\nThe [[Keris]] dagger special effect works against them.\n\nThough not directly assigned, Locust riders may be slain as part of a [[Scabarite]] assignment. These monsters respawn at an extremely fast rate, so it may be ideal to stay in one spot.\n\nA good strategy to kill these is to wear prayer-boosting armour, such as [[Proselyte armour]] and use [[Protect from Ranged]] as the rangers can hit harder than the meleers and from further away. When your prayer gets low, go back up to [[Sophanem]] and recharge your prayer at the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]'s altar.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Sophanem Dungeon]]\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=27100}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Locust rider}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Battlestaff|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune sq shield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant arrow|Quantity=36|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=18|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=250|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=35|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Lava rune|Quantity=150|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune arrow|Quantity=18|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|20/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|20/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|2/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{RareSeedDropTable2|2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw lobster|Quantity=15 (noted)|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite ore|Quantity=14 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coal|Quantity=32 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Desert goat horn|Quantity=6 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril bar|Quantity=22 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw bass|Quantity=24 (noted)|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut sapphire|Quantity=4 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=2000-3000|Rarity=32/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Waterskin(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bass|Quantity=6|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Lobster|Quantity=5|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Marrentill tar|Quantity=80|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Rare drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|1/128|15/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=15 September 2016|update=Superior Slayer Encounters|poll=Old School Content Poll 47: Rewards for Raids & Slayer|change=The drop table was improved to include more valuable drops.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Contact!}}",

He sided with [[Zamorak]] in his rebellion against [[Zaros]].\n\nSpeaking with Lucien starts the [[Temple of Ikov]] [[quest]], and he gives you the [[pendant of lucien]] needed in the quest. During the quest, the player is tasked with stealing the [[Staff of Armadyl]] from the [[Temple of Ikov (dungeon)|Temple of Ikov]]. However, the player is later given the choice to side with the guardians of Armadyl or continuing aiding Lucien.\n\nLucien must be defeated at the end of the [[Temple of Ikov]] quest if you sided with Armadyl.\n\n==History==\n===Early History===\nLike the other [[Mahjarrat]], Lucien lived on [[Freneskae]], a harsh and desolate world of perpetual warfare. In the [[Second Age]] of [[Gielinor]], the two demi-gods [[Icthlarin]] and [[Amascut]] travelled to Freneskae in order to recruit the Mahjarrat to fight the [[Zaros]]ian invaders of their homeland, the [[Kharidian Desert|Kharidian Empire]], in the Kharidian - Zarosian War. There, Lucien aided the Menaphite warriors in driving back the Zarosian army, with success. During this time, they were known as the Stern Judges of Icthlarin.\n\nHowever the Mahjarrat did not remain loyal to the [[Menaphite Pantheon]] and soon betrayed them and joined Zaros. In the Zarosian Empire the Mahjarrat rose to the top of society and played an essential part in its rise and fall. Centuries later unrest began appearing among some of the Mahjarrat, particularly [[Zamorak]], the highest general in the Zarosian Army, who began to conspire against Zaros.\n\nLucien allied with [[Zamorak]] in his effort to overthrow Zaros. After Zaros' fall Lucien joined Zamorak's ranks and remained so during the [[God Wars]].\n\nAt some point Lucien had a {{RSL|Moia|daughter}} with an unknown mother.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn Year 154 of the [[Fifth Age]] Lucien led an infamous attack on [[Varrock]], but was quickly defeated, thanks to a strong [[Misthalin]] guard and a sufficient supply of [[runes]]. Defeated, Lucien went into hiding, plotting to gain hands on a powerful artefact to increase his powers.\n\nIn Year 169 Lucien, in disguise, attempted to convince [[player character|an adventurer]] to retrieve the [[Staff of Armadyl]] from the [[Temple of Ikov (dungeon)|Temple of Ikov]]. He gave them a pendant to help them pass through the temple's defences. The adventurer was confronted by the [[Guardian of Armadyl|Guardians of Armadyl]], who tried to protect the Staff. The adventurer either continued their quest and stole the Staff and brought it to Lucien, or they allied with the Guardians and attempted to kill Lucien in his house near [[Edgeville]]. No matter the outcome Lucien afterwards disappears to [[the North]].\n\n==Dialogue==\n{{hastranscript|NPC}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you try to attack Lucien before the end of the [[Temple of Ikov]] [[quest]] without wearing the [[Armadyl pendant]], he says \"You do not want to attack me. I am your friend.\" He then waves his hand similar to the ''{{wp|Star Wars}}'' Jedi mind trick. The chatbox will then state \"You decide not to attack Lucien. He is your friend.\"\n[[File:Temple of Ikov - Lucien mind trick.gif|thumb|left|200px|Lucien using a mind trick on players who aren't wearing the pendant of Armadyl.]]\n{{Mahjarrat}}\n{{Temple of Ikov}}\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

Both its standard attacks can hit very high, though they are somewhat inaccurate. It is recommended to pray melee.

If hit by the projectile (magic), it will inflict up to 38 damage and [[Stun (status)|immobilise]] the player for a few seconds. The message box states \"''You have been trapped in stone!''\" when this occurs.

A [[Slayer bell]] is necessary to fight them. Players should remember to bring a [[Light sources|light source]] when fighting them, as they are only found underground. Despite what their level would suggest, Molanisks do unusually low damage, meaning a relatively mid-level player with half-decent [[armour]] should easily be able to kill several of them.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon]] ([[Fairy rings|Fairy ring]] {{fairycode|AJQ}}, a [[Light sources|light source]] is required)\n*The Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon itself is located directly south of the [[Dorgesh-Kaan|city]] and can be accessed by going directly south until you come to the [[Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course]]. Once there, a ladder can be used into the dungeon proper where, slightly to the south-east (take the first pathway to the east, near the water) a single Molanisk can be seen.\n\n==Strategy==\n[[File:Molanisk hiding.png|thumb|170px|left|A molanisk disguised on a wall.]]\nMolanisks are found attached to cave walls and must be lured off with a [[Slayer bell]] to allow players to attack them. When lured off the wall, they are [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]] towards the player who lured them off with the bell. Molanisks [[Spawning|respawn]] relatively quickly, so players who want to conserve [[Energy|run energy]] can just stay at the same respawn location. Bringing a [[stamina potion]] allows for a quicker task.\n\nMolanisks have a low maximum hit and their attacks aren't very accurate, however their hits can mount up. Therefore, a small amount of [[food]] is recommended up to [[Defence]] level 80 for larger tasks (over 100). An alternative would be picking up [[bones]] and using the [[Bones to Bananas]] or [[Bones to Peaches]] spell. Due to their maximum hit being so low, level 40 Defence and [[Adamant equipment#Armour|adamant]] or [[Rune equipment#Armour|rune armour]] is sufficient.\n\nMolanisks are relatively weak to both [[Crush weapons|crush]] and [[magic]] attacks.\n\nMolanisks can only be [[safespot]]ted on certain rocks, notably the large one down the path south of the [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]].\n\nIf you are getting attacked by another monster, for example a [[Cave Crawler]], and then use the Slayer bell, the Molanisk will attack you and the monster initially attacking you will lose its aggression.\n[[File:Molanisk safespot.png|thumb|300px|A [[safespot]] for molanisks.]]\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=61398}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=1-14|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=1-20|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=1-5|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=1-7|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mud rune|Quantity=1-15|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|32/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|32/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Swamp weed|Quantity=1-4|Rarity=37/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Swamp weed|Quantity=5-8|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=1-75|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mole claw|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Rare drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|7/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (easy)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Tide|url=https://twitter.com/JagexTide/status/1131933683714330624|date=24 May 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/WUqwD|archivedate=24 May 2019|quote=I know its been a while since the clue expansion but here is the information on clue scroll drop rates and loot chances!

They reside on the {{FloorNumber|1}} and {{FloorNumber|2}} of [[Ape Atoll]]'s [[Temple of Marimbo]] and are the strongest guard found on Ape Atoll. They have a large amount of health and throw vicious punches that can hit up to 14. When they have very low health, they will beat their chest, causing them to heal 25 hitpoints which is about 20% of their\u00a0[[hitpoints]]; they appear to be able to do this indefinitely but only while in melee range. Monkey Guards drop larger versions of monkey bones, which give 18 prayer experience points when buried. However, these are not tradeable.\n\nThe bearded Monkey Guards can be a nuisance because they cannot be walked through, and after exiting the dungeon in the temple, bearded Monkey Guards can surround you, stopping you from exiting the temple. A way out of this is to climb up the ladder near the trapdoor.\n\nThere is a way, however, to kill the Monkey Guards (including bearded variants) using melee as a player with relatively low combat stats. Monkey Guards can be brought down to 26-35 HP by normal attacks. The player can then poison the Monkey Guard using a [[Dragon dagger(p++)]] or other super-poisoned weapon. Once the Monkey Guard is poisoned, and before the Monkey Guard heals, the player can run out of range of the poisoned Monkey Guard, and wait for the poison damage to finish him off. The south-western corner of the Monkey Guard temple is a good place to poison and safespot one of the Monkey Guards, as there is a ladder that the player can hide behind. You can also [[flinch]] the Monkey Guards to avoid them using their healing ability.\n\n==Benefits==\nBecause the Monkey Guards heal themselves and because there is an altar in the temple, players can choose to train combat of all forms by fighting them with [[Protect from Melee]] and stat-boosting prayers. The only downside to this method is the Monkey Guards' high defence. When players are low on [[Prayer]], they can pray at the nearby altar. The Monkey Guards also heal themselves often, providing more experience per kill, but making it difficult to kill them for their bones.\n\nPlayers should wear strength-boosting armour, as prayer bonus is irrelevant with the nearby altar. Using [[Dharok the Wretched's equipment]] here used to be a popular activity, but it is much more advisable to do this at [[Nightmare Zone]] instead. It is wise to have multiple [[antipoison]]s or to use [[Rapid Heal]], in case the nearby level 1 [[spider]] poisons you (poison hits for 1).\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Monkey bones (gorilla)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only dropped by beardless Monkey Guards.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Monkey bones (bearded gorilla)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only dropped by bearded Monkey Guards.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled monkey head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/35}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n{{Ape Atoll}}\n[[Category:Monkeys]]",

One or two of these may appear along with one of the named ninja monkeys. The named monkeys are [[Duke]], [[Uodai]], [[Ouhai]], [[Oipuis]], and [[Uyoro]].\n\nUnlike the named ninja monkeys, the monkey guards only drop small ninja monkey bones, which can also be obtained from killing the abundant [[Monkey Archer]]s.\n\nIf they hit the player, the player will appear in the Ape Atoll prison, making it tricky to kill these.\n\nInstead of killing these yourself, they can be killed for small monkey ninja bones by walking in monkey form on the trapdoor in the warehouse, then quickly taking the [[greegree]] off and waiting for them to appear. If [[Karam]] notices them, he will kill them instantly. If he does not kill them all, simply re-equip the greegree and the monkey guards will disappear when they try to attack you. Afterwards, equip your greegree and pick up the bones.\n\nFor the RFD \"Monkey Ambassador\" portion, to obtain a ninja greegree simply kill a monkey archer (combat level 83) on the third level of the Ape Atoll Temple. \n\nPlayers could also kill them by getting them stuck behind an obstacle. [[Solihib]]'s hut is perfect for this, as when players talk to Solihib in human form, the guards are often stuck behind a jungle plant, and players can safely kill them with [[ranged]] or [[magic]]. However, the player should have decent stats and be quick as they disappear after a while.\n\nFor players with a high combat level, killing them directly may be easier as Karam does not always notice them and he himself often gets stuck on obstacles.\n\n==Habitat==\n*[[Ape Atoll]]\n\n{{Ape Atoll}}\n[[Category:Monkeys]]",

    "Monster": "{{external|rs|rsc}}\n'''Monster''' is the official term for an [[Combat|attackable]] character or being that is not [[player]]-controlled. A monster can range from a not-so-harmful [[Rat]] to the extremely strong [[Chaos Elemental]]. Monsters are often fought by players for [[training]], entertainment, and [[loot]]. [[Monster killing|Killing monsters]] is one of the most popular activities in ''RuneScape''. Nearly all monsters drop [[remains]].\n\nWhile some monsters will never begin a fight with a player, many high level creatures are [[aggressive]], potentially causing unwanted death. If a player has over double the [[combat level]] of the monster, the monster will be docile, and will only attack when provoked. However, in areas such as the [[Wilderness]], most monsters are indefinitely aggressive. As a rule of thumb, \"humanoids\" are not aggressive towards players except in some cases when the humanoid's nature or occupation has malign or criminal connotations (i.e. [[Black Knight]], [[Zombie]], [[Mugger]]). Most cities are also safe from aggressive monsters, though the perimeter or surroundings may not be as secure.\n\n==Combat features==\n*Most monsters are NPCs with a combat level and attack option (Not including random event characters)\n*The combat level of monsters is calculated in a similar way to a player's combat level\n*Melee monsters will follow you if you try to get away during fighting\n*Ranged and magic monsters will follow you only if you try to get away from missile range, or behind a wall.\n*Some monsters will retreat if their health gets too low\n*Melee monsters will chase you if attacked far away\n*Monsters will retreat if the attacker moves out of patrol range\n*Monsters will not even react at all if the attacker is too far to be seen (mostly happens if attacking the monster with [[ranged]] or [[magic]].)\n*All monsters can get stuck at walls and obstacles.\n*For larger monsters, the monster's active spot is on the south-western corner of the monster, meaning that this spot will be following you in combat; it is also where the monster's drop will appear after it dies.

They usually use [[crush weapons]], which, combined with their relatively high Strength, can hit rather hard. However, they attack slowly and are quite inaccurate, so it's not strictly necessary to use [[protection prayers]] for players that have high [[Defence]]. A good strategy for conserving supplies is to use [[Bones to Peaches]] on the Big bones that they drop; this will almost always cover any damage they manage to deal.

After [[Mourning's End Part II]], the basement can be accessed easily by selecting the [[Dark beast]]s teleport on a [[slayer ring]], and running through the door to the east.

They are found within the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], [[Iorwerth Dungeon]] and the [[Meiyerditch Laboratories]].\n\nLike regular bloodvelds, a mutated bloodveld's attacks are [[magic-based melee]]. They are known to damage frequently due to their high attack level, so equipping armour with high Magic defence is highly recommended to mitigate their attacks. They can also be [[safespot]]ted with ease. Alternatively, players can opt to wear [[Prayer equipment]] while using the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer, using [[Prayer potion]]s instead of food. Players can also teleport to an altar and then teleport back to the Catacombs instead of using prayer potions, since these bloodvelds are so close to the entrance.\n\nMutated bloodvelds are popular for players willing to spend time completing their task, as they provide better experience than normal bloodvelds. They also drop more [[blood rune]]s at a higher rate compared to normal bloodvelds, in addition to the [[ancient shard]] and [[dark totem]] pieces they drop in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]], and the [[crystal shard]]s they drop in the [[Iorwerth Dungeon]]. On average, a player can expect to receive 3.6 blood runes per mutated bloodveld kill.\n\n[[File:Mutated Bloodveld (Catacombs of Kourend, 1) safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|An example of a player using a corner to safespot a Mutated Bloodveld.]]\n\n[[File:Mutated Bloodveld (Catacombs of Kourend, 2) safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|An example of a player using other Mutated Bloodvelds as a blockade to safespot.]]\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Catacombs of Kourend]] ([[Multicombat area|multicombat]])\n*[[Iorwerth Dungeon]] (can be cannoned)\n*[[Meiyerditch Laboratories]] ([[Multicombat area|multicombat]], can be cannoned)\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=434982}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Mutated Bloodveld}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant knife|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black boots|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=105|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=75|Rarity=9/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=7|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=4|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=350|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=11|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bow string|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Meat pie|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ruby amulet|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Rare and Gem drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|3/128|2/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref name='elite' group='d'>The elite clue scroll and casket are only dropped when completing an elite clue scroll asking you to kill a Bloodveld</ref>|gemw=No|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Reward casket (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref name='elite' group='d' />|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled bloodveld head|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/20}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Crystal shard|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/24|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"d\">Crystal shards are only dropped by those found within the [[Iorwerth Dungeon]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|123|bonus=yes}}|Raritynotes=<ref group='d'>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1104000231765622784|date=8 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Bd630|archivedate=23 March 2019|quote=That's rather odd, since they're only 1/128.

It is a [[dog]]-like creature that has horribly mutated into a giant crocodilian beast. The original muttadile was pregnant at the time when [[Xeric]] transformed it into its current form and as such its offspring was warped too. The two beasts now act as guardians of the chambers.\n\n==Mechanics==\nThe two muttadiles that reside in the chamber are present upon entering; a small one is on the ground and the large one is lurking in the water.\n\nThe small muttadile attacks with both [[Melee]] and [[Ranged]]. While this smaller muttadile is alive, the larger one will stay submerged in the water, where it is unattackable and attacks players with [[Magic]] (which covers the whole chamber). Standing in melee range, activating [[Protect from Melee]] and using [[Ranged gear]] is recommended for the small muttadile. This is due to protection prayers blocking its melee attacks entirely while ranged attacks only partially, as well as it using melee more often. In bigger groups though, it's easier to stay outside of its melee range and pray [[Protect from Missiles]], as staying close to it with multiple people for the muttadile to target can be difficult.\n[[File:Fighting_Muttadile.png|thumb|left|250px|A group of players facing the larger muttadile.]]\n\nWhen the smaller muttadile dies, the larger one emerges from the water and starts attacking the players in the room. Apart from having higher stats and using all three forms of [[combat]], this larger muttadile will also perform a shockwave attack if anyone is within melee range, dealing massive damage to everyone in melee range, which can hit as high as <b>118</b>. For this reason, it is advised to stay outside of its melee range at all costs. In some orientations of the muttadile room, corners will act as [[safespot]]s. Always keep Protect from Missiles active when fighting the larger muttadile, as it reduces its ranged attack greatly. Its magic attack can hit multiple people, but there's no way of predicting if it will. Due to its high Magic level, the [[Twisted bow]] is very effective on it.\n\nAs the muttadiles' health reaches about 40%, they will go to the nearby [[meat tree]] and start eating it to replenish health, up to three times each. Ideally, the muttadiles should be prevented from healing themselves at the meat tree. In team raids, the most common way is for a player to use [[Ice Barrage]] on the small muttadile (due to its low Magic level and defence) and the [[Zamorak godsword]] special attack on the large muttadile when they are at half health. [[Piety]] and melee gear are recommended to make the special attack more accurate.

The combat levels of Nail beasts are based on the difficulty of the event chosen: they are level 69 on easy, level 98 on medium, and level 141 on hard. The number encountered also depends on the difficulty of the event: on an easy event, players will see between two and three Nail beasts, on a medium event they will see between three and four, and on a hard event anywhere between four and six will appear.\n\nThey are not very strong, but they hit 3 times every attack (3 times in 7 [[tick]]s) and are very accurate, even against high-defence armour. Players should keep an eye on their follower's [[Hitpoints]] and on their own. [[Prayer]] will not block the second or third attack if the first attack hits the player.\n\nNail beasts are weak to [[Sanfew serum]]s if they are \"used\" on them, which deals 20-40 damage per dose and grants [[melee]] [[experience]].

He is also among the strongest demons in the game. At the start of each fight he drains a player's prayer points. Like all demons, he is also vulnerable to the effects of [[demonbane weapons]]. He has a very peculiar habit of calling the player 'Vacu'. According to the Shaman [[Ungadulu]] 'Vacu' was the name for the evil priests who served the 'demons of the underworld'.\n\nDespite being a black demon, he is not considered one for the purpose of a [[Slayer task]]. He can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete, but will not drain prayer points there.\n==First battle==\nNezikchened has possessed [[Ungadulu]], the shaman of the [[Kharazi Jungle]]. Players must use the book of binding on him to reveal his true form. He will then drain the player's prayer and attacks with melee, or magic if the player is out of reach. He can be easily defeated if you use protect from melee while standing next to him while keeping your prayer points above 0 by drinking prayer potions. Stabbing him with [[demonbane weapons]] or throwing a vial of [[holy water]] at him can weaken him. This is thought to be the easiest of Nezikchened's three phases, as it is very predictable and only one prayer will be needed. Recommended attack style for players is ranged, due to its inherent accuracy, melee works nearly as well. It's not recommended to use magic unless you have a high magic level (75+), as his magic level of 160 makes him highly resistant to spells.\n\n==Second battle==\nNezikchened appears again disguised as the ghost Echned Zekin, an anagram for Nezikchened, and will ask players to kill the spirit [[Viyeldi]]. Players who do so will save time initially but will have to fight [[Ranalph Devere]], [[Irvig Senay]] and [[San Tojalon]] in the final battle. Players who do not wish to kill Viyeldi can go back and speak to [[Ungadulu]] who will give the player a [[Holy force]] card, which can be used to weaken Nezichened. Whichever path they choose, when players return to Echned Zekin, he will turn into Nezikchened and fight the player. Just like before he drains the player's prayer, unless they use the holy force spell card on him first. He will begin attacking you with a weak magic attack at first, but then switches to melee. He may also throw a dagger at you (if the player took the short route and killed Viyeldi) which may do some amount of damage. Assuming he uses the attack at all, the demon will only throw the dagger once throughout the course of the fight. This fight is relatively similar to the first one, in terms of difficulty.\n\n==Final battle==\nAt the end of the quest, players must fight the demon one last time. Before you begin the fight it's recommended you turn on Protect from melee, as the demon will get a few free hits while the player is stalled. He will, like before, drain prayer at the beginning and then proceed to attack with melee, or a hard hitting magical attack if the player is out of melee range. An effective way to defeat the demon involves safespotting him by hiding in the trees nearby and attacking him with ranged. Melee can also be used but players should be wary, as his melee attack has a chance of hitting you through protect from melee.\n\nIf players chose the \"short\" route during the quest, he will also spawn [[Ranalph Devere]], [[Irvig Senay]] and [[San Tojalon]] one at a time in an attempt to weaken the player. Make sure your prayer points are high and protect from melee is on after you kill a skeleton, as you'll be unable to act for a few seconds.\n\nAfter the player has delivered the final blow to Nezikchened, he will exclaim \"I am beaten by a mere mortal...I will revenge myself upon you!\" and the player automatically and sarcastically responds \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before\" right before Nezikchened bursts into flames and dies as he burns into ashes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Legends' Quest}}\n{{Demons}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Each giant key permits one entry to the lair and one attempt to fight Obor. If you change worlds while in the instanced zone, you will be teleported outside the gate.\n\nWhen the player first enters Obor's lair, they will be in a safe zone, where they must climb down the rocks in order to fight him. Obor attacks with [[Melee]] and [[Ranged]], and '''can detect whether the player is using [[protection prayers]]''' against his current attack style. For example, he will use ranging attacks if [[Protect from Melee]] is used.\n\n==Strategy==\n===Magic (Snare)===\n[[File:Fighting Obor.png|thumb|right|250px|A player fighting Obor, the Hill Titan.]]\nAn easy strategy for lower-level players (with {{SCP|Magic|50|link=yes}} and {{SCP|Prayer|40|link=yes}}) is to always turn on the [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer BEFORE climbing down, and then using [[Snare]] to prevent Obor from reaching you. Cast Snare every time Obor is able to walk again. Use Magic to kill him. You will want to use [[magic armour]] as this will increase your magic accuracy and thus your chances of a successful [[Snare]] cast. For better chance at success, wait for Obor to be as close to one side of the room before Snaring, then run to the other side, casting offensive spells in between. Wait until he walks to the opposite wall again before repeating. Even with this strategy, however, bring enough food, as Obor can do serious damage as soon as the Snare wears off. If you are free-to-play you might want to bring an [[energy potion]] as well.\n\nIt can be useful to know that Obor does not always keep walking up to [[melee]] distance before attacking, but never attacks when unable to move. This means he might stop walking towards you before standing next to you, giving you the time to snare or bind him without having to run to the other side of the arena. This makes it easier to cast more spells in a shorter amount of time, making the fight more efficient.\n\n===Magic (Tank)===\nAs Obor is weak to magic, this is the preferred combat style for members with at least {{SCP|Magic|50|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Defence|60|link=yes}} and 42 in the other combat stats. Players with 75 Magic should use the [[Trident of the Swamp]] as Obor is susceptible to poison. You should wear [[Void Knight equipment|void knight]] or [[Elite Void Knight equipment|elite void knight]] equipment with the [[void mage helm]]. Stand with your back against a wall to avoid knock-backs. Pray a Defence-boosting prayer such as [[Steel Skin]]. Expect to take more damage using this method.\n\n===Ranged===\nDiscouraged for free-to-play as you do not have access to decent armour and weapons. Members with {{SCP|Ranged|75|link=yes}} should use a [[Toxic Blowpipe]] as Obor is susceptible to poison.\n\n===Melee===\nMelee is also a good option since it is quicker than the Magic (Snare) method to kill Obor, but it will be more dangerous. 50s are needed for all melee stats, and 60 Defence. Pray a Defence-boosting prayer such as [[Steel Skin]]. Obor's slam attack will knock you back, so stand next to a wall and tank if possible. Members can use an [[Abyssal whip]] or a [[Dragon scimitar]], while free-to-play players can use a [[Rune scimitar]]. You will also want good [[melee armour]] with decent melee and ranged defensive stats. If you are free-to-play you might want to bring a [[strength potion]] as well. \n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=14540}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Obor}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (beginner)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ensouled giant head|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/118|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1002111464482705408|date=31 May 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/BPkPx|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=3/118}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Hill giant club|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/118|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/836949215158890496|date=1 March 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/1sFeT|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=1 / 118.}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=50-99|Rarity=12/118|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/826835915020570624|date=1 February 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/fjZsg|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=7, 10, 10 and 12 / 118 respectively [for nature, chaos, death, and law runes].|name=oborrateash}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=60-119|Rarity=12/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=100-199|Rarity=10/118|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|oborrateash}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=40-79|Rarity=10/118|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|oborrateash}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=40-79|Rarity=7/118|Raritynotes={{NamedRef|oborrateash}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10000-20000|Rarity=10/118|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=8/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=50 (noted)|Rarity=8/118}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=5 (noted)|Rarity=5/118|Raritynotes=<ref name=\"gems\" group=d>Uncut rubies and diamonds always drop together.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut diamond|Quantity=5 (noted)|Rarity=5/118|Raritynotes=<ref name=\"gems\" group=d></ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Giant key|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/16|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/857953447525699584|date=31 May 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/tbjFD|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=It's got a 1/16 chance for Obor to drop another one.}}|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Giant champion scroll|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* 'Obor' translates to 'Giant' in the {{wp|Slovak language}}.\n* Obor was originally suggested by Reddit user ''Mjterp''.

They have small tusks protruding from their jaws, and prefer to wield large axes and/or maces.\n\nOrks can be found in the [[God Wars Dungeon]], in the army of [[Bandos]]. These Orks are notable as the most reliable soldiers in the army of Bandos, as they can hit up to 12 health points. Players should also beware that if they kill an Ork, all nearby Orks will become aggressive to the player. Also, if players have dealt damage to an ork which is eventually slain by other monsters, the orks around would still become aggressive. The strength of the ancient Orks is unusual, but all the recently-thawed combatants in the dungeon are stronger than their modern versions. It is unknown if they truly worship Bandos as their patron god, were forced into service like the [[goblin]]s, or simply fight out of entertainment rather than loyalty or necessity.\n\nOrks also appear at a certain point in [[A Fairy Tale Part 2]]. The [[Fairy Godfather]] is trying to replace the [[Fairy Queen]] and the [[Fairy|fairies]] with Orks. Some of these Orks have no shown level, and some are level 20, but neither type can be attacked. They can be talked to, but all they say is \"Grunt! Smelly, stinky human! Urgh! Leave us alone before we hurt you.\"\n\nOrks are good for training melee at high levels. One should bring prayer potions and pray protect from melee while fighting them, and restore prayer as necessary. They will continue to be aggressive after you have slain an Ork.\n\nDespite their high combat level, orks only drop lower level combat metals such as bronze, iron, and occasionally steel. However, they do drop level easy and hard clue scrolls.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze dart|Quantity=2|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze halberd|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron dart|Quantity=2|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron spear|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=5|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=12|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=23|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Knife|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Looting bags are only dropped by those located in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ecumenical key|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/60|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Ecumenical keys are only dropped by those located in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (easy)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=clue>Clue scroll drop rates are increased to 1/64 if a [[ring of wealth (i)]] is worn and fought in the [[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=clue />|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=8 August 2019|update=Smithing and Silver Crafting Interfaces|change=The drop rate for [[ecumenical key]]s have been changed to be 1/60 regardless of keys owned.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Fairytale II - Cure a Queen}}\n{{God Wars Dungeon}}\n[[Category:Bandosians]]",

Healing using food stolen from nearby stalls is also an alternative.\n\nPaladins are weak to [[Magic]] and Crush attacks.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|8/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|8/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=48|Rarity=40/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=15|Rarity=19/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=2|Rarity=16/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=10/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=120|Rarity=2/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|2/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (medium)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Pickpocketing==\nA successful pickpocket attempt will gain the following loot:\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLineThieving|Name=Coins|Quantity=80|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLineThieving|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}{{#set:Thieving level=70}}\n\n{{Pickpocket}}\n{{Song of the Elves}}\n{{East Ardougne}}\n[[Category:Saradominists]]",

This will spread to other players in the raid also and can therefore kill a party very quickly.\n\nAfter seven or fourteen cycles of mutilated flesh falling from the ceiling, it will stop moving, allowing players to attack it. After a few seconds, it will stomp the surrounding area, dealing large amounts of damage. If a player is hit by a mutilated flesh, it will deal 30\u201350 damage and stun them temporarily. Falling flesh can be evaded beforehand by looking for their shadow on the floor.\n\nThe Bloat will also change direction randomly throughout the fight.

He grew up in a society structure, that had been created by the god [[Zaros]] a long time ago. The burgeoning House Drakan became one of the most prominent [[Vampyre Houses]] and ultimately was able to subjugate the other seven Houses under Lowerniel's leadership.\n\nEventually, [[Zaros]] returned to the planet and requested the vampyres to join him and contribute to his [[Zarosian Empire|empire]]. Ranis went along with his siblings.\n\n===Conquest of Hallowvale===\nRanis participated in the fall of Hallowvale. He got along well with [[Verzik Vitur]], as Vanescula stated that both of them liked to \"play\" with their food. The two nobles were able to capture a Saradominist [[Justiciar]] and tortured him for several days. The Justiciar soon gave in and revealed a tunnel underneath the royal castle, which allowed Lowerniel to send vampyres, who were able to abduct [[Ascertes]] Hallow in the process. This would become well known in history, with Ranis taking most of the credit, although Vanescula believed that Verzik deserved it more. He was compensated richly alongside Verzik for swiftly ending the war, although what he obtained from Lowerniel remains unknown.\n\n===Overseeing Darkmeyer===\nAs Lowerniel spent more and more time about the [[Stone of Jas]], Ranis was tasked with Vanescula to oversee Morytania on his behalf. Ranis complied and did not appear to care much about the state of affairs, unaware that her sister was plotting to overthrow Lowerniel for his perceived incompetence in the growing society.\n\nHe is first seen outside Castle Drakan feasting on some blood tithes offered to him by a juvinate alongside [[Vanstrom Klause]] and Vanesceula.\n\n===Hunting the Myreque and Death===\nAs the threat of the Myreque grew, Vanstrom approached Ranis and recruited him to help end the Myreque once and for all. The two headed to [[Ver Sinhaza]] and met with Verzik, who gave them her [[abomination]] to help track them down. Vanstrom went to [[Serafina]]'s home and made an elaborate trap that resulted in Safalaan giving his blood, allowing the abomination to track them to their hideout. Believing that Myreque were annihilated by the abomination, Ranis went to Ver Sinhaza to claim that the Myreque were destroyed in front of an assembled audience.\n\nHe was then confronted by the player, revealing that the Myreque were not destroyed. Although he had numerous powers at his disposal, alongside some vyrewatch assistance, he was no match for the [[ivandis flail]] and was killed by them. His body was left briefly at the castle grounds, where it was found by Vanstrom and Vanescula. The incident shook the vampyre nobility, and the player soon became known as the Slayer. Ranis' death would contribute to Lowerniel stepping out once more to deal with the growing Myreque threat.\n\n==Mechanics==\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Fighting Ranis Drakan.png|thumb|left|200px|The player confronts Ranis Drakan with the Ivandis flail.]]\nRanis Drakan is level 233, and can only be harmed by the [[Ivandis flail]]. He will use [[melee]] and [[magic]] attacks that can hit up to 20. He can also cast [[Blood Barrage]], which can heal him for half of the damage dealt. Occasionally, he will charge an attack and explode, hitting up to 30. The damage can be reduced by running away from him when he is charging the attack.\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Ranis' blood bomb.png|thumb|200px|left|Ranis launches his blood bomb attack.]]\nAfter he reaches 65% of his health, he'll summon two level 87 [[vyrewatch]] and will fly airborne. Every now and then, he will throw blood bombs at where you are currently standing, which can hit up to 40. It should be noted that this attack '''can''' hit the vyrewatch, so it can be used to aid combat, especially at lower levels. When you kill the vyrewatch, you will fight Ranis again until he reaches 25% of his health, where he will then summon two vyrewatch again.\n\nAfter killing them, he will go berserk and attack the player. During this last phase, his attacks are much faster and accurate, but only have a max hit of 6. Using [[Protect from Melee]] will easily defeat him in the last phase.\n\nIf you die during the fight, your items can be [[Item Retrieval Service|retrieved]] from the chest located north-west of the noticeboard for 20,000 [[coins]].\n\n{{Vampyres}}\n{{Darkness of Hallowvale}}\n{{A Taste of Hope}}\n[[Category:Rulers]]",

Their appearance is closely related to that of a mole with over sized claws and red eyes. Although they do not attack the [[Void Knight]] directly, they are capable of tearing down the gates and barricades with just a few swipes of their claws, giving [[Torcher]]s and [[Defiler]]s a clearer shot at the Void Knight.

Unlike most other enemies and [[NPCs]], Rock Crabs are not marked with yellow dots on the player's [[minimap]]; this is probably due to the crabs' appearance, which camouflages them as rocks.\n\nPlayers can tell if a rock is a Rock Crab by looking at the rock's shape; Rock Crabs are tall oval shaped while normal rocks in their area are mostly in large clusters of shattered pieces. Another way to tell is by right clicking on them. If the text colour is yellow, it is a Rock Crab. If the text is blue, it is just a prop.\n\nRock Crabs become docile if the player has not left the surrounding area in a certain amount of time (roughly between ten and twenty-five minutes). To make the crabs aggressive again, exit the surrounding area (halfway to the entrance to the village in [[Rellekka]], or by entering and exiting the entrance to [[Keldagrim]]) and enter again. You can also find one Rock Crab that will be aggressive, kill it then you can continue killing other crabs. As they are \"dormant\" until \"awoken\" by a passing player, rock crabs cannot be attacked until they are made aggressive once more.\n\nRock Crabs are excellent for training at all [[combat level]]s due to their low [[Defence]] and high [[Hitpoints]], though low level players should consider bringing [[food]]. Rock Crabs used to be a popular [[Pay-to-play melee training|melee training]] monster until the release of [[Sand Crab]]s, and the subsequent release of [[Ammonite Crab]]s, which are now more preferred options for training.\n\nHowever, due to Sand Crabs being very crowded, some players choose to train on [[Waterbirth Island]], as it has multiple convenient spawn locations where a player can stand still and always have 3-4 Rock Crabs attacking them at any moment, making it comparable to the experience rates of Sand Crabs. The player can simply reset the aggressiveness of the Rock Crab by running back to the boat to leave Waterbirth Island, then running back to their desired training spot.\n\n==Locations==\n* North-east of [[Rellekka]]\n* [[Waterbirth Island]]\n* {{TL}}[[Mount Quidamortem]]\n\n===Rellekka Rock Crabs===\n[[File:Rock Crab (Relleka) - avoiding cannonading.png|thumb|220x220px|The spot to avoid cannonading in Rellekka.]]\nNote: [[Dwarf multicannon]]s may be used here, unlike with the other types of crabs commonly used for training. This can make training for other players difficult. There is, however, a way to avoid the cannon's fire. If a player moves to the west-most part of the [[multi-combat]] zone, most cannon fire can be avoided. There are three rock crab spawns near this location, which makes it a decent spot. Although the cannon's fire can be avoided, it is best to switch to another world when faced with overcrowding.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bronze pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seaweed===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seaweed|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seaweed|Quantity=2|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Seaweed|Quantity=5|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Edible seaweed|Quantity=2|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Ores===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tin ore|Quantity=3|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron ore|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coal|Quantity=2|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Copper ore|Quantity=3|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Oyster===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oyster|Quantity=2|Rarity=12/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oyster|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Empty oyster|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Empty oyster|Quantity=3|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oyster pearl|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=4|Rarity=29/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=8|Rarity=6/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=36|Rarity=8/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=19/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fishing bait|Quantity=10|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Opal bolt tips|Quantity=5|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Spinach roll|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Casket|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref name=elite group=d>Elite clue scrolls or elite caskets are only dropped when completing a [[Treasure Trails/Full guide/Elite#Cryptic clues|elite cryptic clue]] asking the player to kill a Rock Crab.</ref>|gemw=No|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Reward casket (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref name=elite group=d />|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (easy)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sand Crab]] ([[King Sand Crab|King]])\n*[[Swamp Crab]]\n*[[Ammonite Crab]]\n*[[Experiment]]\n\n{{Brine Rat Cavern}}\n{{Waterbirth Island}}",

After completion of the [[quest]], they can be found in the eastern chamber of the [[Lithkren Vault]].\n\nTo get back to the laboratory underneath [[Lithkren]], players can travel using the rowboat from the quest on the west side of the [[Fossil Island|island]] or, after completion, taking a [[digsite pendant]] and using it on the strange machine north of the rune dragon room, adding a teleport straight to Lithkren on it.\n\nRune dragons are the result of a side project of Zorgoth's after being inspired by another [[dragonkin]], [[Forcae]], which involves infusing [[Dragon (race)|dragon]] eggs with various metals. While Forcae's metal dragons were created to find a solution to the dragonkin's infertility, Zorgoth had bred his metal dragons for his [[Dragonkin Conflicts|war against humanity]].\n\nAt 99 [[Construction]], players can add [[Rune dragon (Construction)|them]] to their [[player-owned house]] [[treasure room]]s for 25,000,000 coins.\n\n==Attacks==\nRune dragons have multiple attacks, similar to [[Mithril dragon|mithril]] and [[adamant dragon]]s. Along with standard [[dragonfire]] attacks, they have a standard [[melee]], [[ranged]] and [[magic]] attack (which resembles [[Water Wave]]), as well as two special attacks.\n\nThe first attack is two small electric bolts, which are launched around the player's position and homes in on them. This deals 4-7 damage per tick for a few seconds. If a player is wearing [[insulated boots]], this damage is reduced to 1-2 per tick. Players can avoid the attack entirely by running four to five squares away from their original position when the attack was launched.\n\nThe second attack is a ranged attack that hits through [[Protect from Missiles]], and uses the ''Life Leech'' effect from [[onyx bolts (e)|enchanted onyx bolts]], where the dragon will heal itself for 100% of the damage dealt to the player.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\nThe average rune dragon kill, including its unique drops, is worth {{Coins|{{#vardefineecho:onerunedragLoot|{{#expr:\n\n{{#vardefineecho:runedragUniq|{{#expr:\n1/800*{{GEP|Dragon limbs}} +\n1/5000*{{GEP|Dragon metal lump}} +\n1/8000*{{GEP|Draconic visage}}\n}}}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:runedragReg|{{#expr:\n1 * {{GEP|Dragon bones}} +\n1 * {{GEP|Runite bar}} +\n(9/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune platebody}} +\n(8/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune longsword}} +\n(7/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune mace}} +\n(7/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune scimitar}} +\n(7/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune warhammer}} +\n(6/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune platelegs}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon platelegs}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon plateskirt}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon med helm}} +\n(8/127) * 40 * {{GEP|Wrath rune}} +\n(7/127) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Chaos rune}} +\n(7/127) * 75 * {{GEP|Death rune}} +\n(11/127) * 25 * {{GEP|Runite bolts (unf)}} +\n(10/127) * 25 * {{GEP|Rune javelin heads}} +\n(8/127) * 35 * {{GEP|Rune arrow}} +\n(5/127) * 35 * {{GEP|Dragon javelin heads}} +\n(1/127) * 30 * {{GEP|Dragon bolts (unf)}} +\n(8/127*10/32) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy avantoe}} +\n(8/127*8/32) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy ranarr weed}} +\n(8/127*8/32) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy snapdragon}} +\n(8/127*6/32) * 1 * {{GEP|Grimy torstol}} +\n(7/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragonstone}} +\n(6/127) * 3.5 * {{GEP|Runite ore}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{GEP|Wrath talisman}} +\n(1/127) * 1 * {{RDTValue}}\n}}}}\n}} }} round 0}}.

He can be found at the end of the dungeon, in an area that requires level 67 [[Agility]] to enter (64 with an [[Agility potion]] or 62 with a [[Summer pie]]). He is\u00a0currently one of only three\u00a0[[NPCs]]\u00a0able to drop the\u00a0[[Sinister key]], alongside the\u00a0[[Magpie impling]]\u00a0and the\u00a0[[Chaos Fanatic]]. This key opens the [[Sinister chest]] that contains nine [[herbs]]: 2 [[Harralander]], 3 [[Ranarr weed]], 1 [[Irit]], 1 [[Kwuarm]], 1 [[Avantoe]], and 1 [[Torstol]]. Salarin is a target for many players because of this drop. Players should keep in mind that the Sinister key is an uncommon drop.\n\nSalarin can only be harmed by [[Strike spells]]: [[Wind Strike]], [[Water Strike]], [[Earth Strike]], and [[Fire Strike]]. He can also be harmed by [[Ring of Recoil|recoil]] damage. [[Melee]] and [[Ranged]] cannot harm him. These spells will always deal 9, 10, 11, and 12 damage (respectively) to him as long as the player does not splash. This damage is '''not''' affected by items that would normally increase spell damage like the [[Smoke battlestaff]], [[Occult necklace]], [[Tome of fire]], etc. This also means that Salarin could be a cheap way of training [[Magic]] because you are guaranteed 23.5, 27.5, 31.5, and 35.5 Magic experience for every successful cast (not including some last hits).\n\n[[Food]] is useful during long trips. High-level players can easily kill Salarin (and the nearby [[chaos druid]]s) multiple times with little or no need for food. If also killing the chaos druids, bringing an [[arrow]]-firing [[Ranged weapon]] will kill them quickly.\n\nThere is a point in the corridor where the player can attack Salarin, and he will try to retreat rather than attack. This is useful for low-level players who are not confident about taking on a high-level monster at close quarters.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=12|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=2|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=3|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=36|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|39/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|39/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=White berries|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Snape grass|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Vial of water|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=3|Rarity=5/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=24|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=10|Rarity=3/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nothing|Rarity=37/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super defence(1)|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Sinister key|Quantity=1|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|1/128|chaostalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/500|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=14 August 2014|update=The Penance Pet & Super Combat Potions|change=The [[Trident of the Seas]] no longer damages Salarin the Twisted.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before the release of the [[Farming]] skill, killing Salarin for the [[Sinister key]] was the only way to obtain [[Torstol]].\n*The area Salarin is found in contains [[Zaros]]ian graves.

Sand Crabs have 10 more [[Hitpoints]] than Rock Crabs and are otherwise identical in stats and behaviour, with clusters of multiple Sand Crabs next to each other in some spots, numbering 4 or more surrounding several spots on [[Crabclaw Isle]]. Players wishing to train on Crabclaw Isle must bring 10,000 coins and may also find these spots to be occupied. Sand Crabs will become [[unaggressive]] if the player has not left the surrounding area in 10 minutes. To make the crabs aggressive again, exit the surrounding area - roughly the same distance as the diameter of the minimap - and enter again. As they are \"dormant\" (and cannot be seen on the [[minimap]]) until \"awoken\" by a passing player, Sand Crabs cannot be attacked until they are made aggressive once more.\n\n[[Ammonite Crab]]s have likewise mostly replaced Sand Crabs. Ammonite Crabs have 100 Hitpoints and level 1 in all other stats, like the other crabs, but have slightly different mechanics; they are spaced far apart, but also have a greater range of aggression. However, there are more available spots to attack Sand Crabs.\n\nBecause of Sand Crabs near-nonexistent offensive and defensive stats, they are an effective training location for low-levelled characters.\n\nThere is an altar somewhat nearby the Sand Crabs, so it may be advisable to recharge [[Prayer]] at this altar whenever resetting their aggression. Players planning to do so would do well to bring equipment with good Prayer bonuses. Additionally, for non-[[ironmen]] players, 55 Prayer unlocks [[Preserve]] and allows potions to last longer while training AFK.\n\nThe new larger sand crab counterpart, [[King Sand Crab]]s are located in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]]. King Sand Crabs only share similarities in name, appearance, and in being dormant until walked near; they are powerful in offensive and defensive stats.\n\n==Getting there==\nSand Crabs are in a remote area and there is no fast way to access them. If you have not been to [[Great Kourend]] before, you will only be able to use method #1. It is advised to bring weight-reducing gear and dump any heavy items that bring your weight above 0.0 kg (lower actually doesn't make a difference in your [[Energy|run drain rate]]), as there is a bank chest in the centre of the beach. There are several ways to get to them. If you haven't been there before, use the world map as you go along to avoid getting lost:\n#Method with no requirements: Go to [[Port Sarim]], speak to [[Veos]] (he is found on the northeast platform) and travel to [[Port Piscarilius]], then run all the way south to the beach on the other side of the continent.\n#Use the fairy ring code {{fairycode|DJR}} and run east, then south. (With 40 [[Agility]] you can use the stepping stones east of the Infirmary.)\n#Use [[Xeric's talisman]] to teleport nearby using the teleport marked \"[[Xeric's Glade]]\".\n#Use the [[skills necklace]] to teleport to the [[Woodcutting Guild]] then run.\n#Use the [[Kharedst's memoirs]] book to teleport to [[Hosidius]], then follow the river south, crossing east over the bridge.\n#Use the [[Minigame teleport]] to the [[Tithe Farm]] and run south-east. This requires having entered Tithe Farm previous which requires 100% Hosidius [[favour]].\n#With access to the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]] (requires 65% [[Lovakengj]] favour) and either 50 coins or having unlocked 'free' transport with 100,000 coins: from Veos, run west and slightly north. Take the minecart to Hosidius, then run southeast. Use the bridge to cross the river, then run south to the beach.\n#Having unlocked [[Kourend Castle Teleport]] and with 69 [[Magic]], use the teleport, run south-southeast, cross the bridges on the way - the eastern bridge across the river if you don't have 45 Agility, and down to the beach.\n#Likely the fastest method, you can either: Move your house to [[Hosidius]] with 25 [[Construction]] and 8,750 coins, teleport to your house, exit the portal, and run south; or, you could use [[scrolls of redirection]] on [[Teleport to house|House teleport tablets]] (still requires 25 Construction) to teleport outside the portal without having to move your house.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Crabclaw Caves}}\n[[Category:Old School-exclusive content]]",

Therefore, it is recommended to bring high strength bonus equipment and a crush weapon like the [[elder maul]], [[abyssal bludgeon]], or [[sarachnis cudgel]], paired with a defence-reducing [[special attack]] such as the [[dragon warhammer]] or [[Bandos godsword]]. [[Dragon claws]] or a [[crystal halberd]] are recommended here for their special attacks if the previously mentioned weapons are not available. Using [[obsidian armour]] with [[Tzhaar-ket-em]] or [[Verac the Defiled's equipment]] sets are also viable options. A budget option, especially for mid-level players, is the [[leaf-bladed battleaxe]] due to its exceptional crush bonus, as well as a high strength bonus and being able to cut through the web just before her lair. [[Dragon mace]] is also a feasible option for lower levelled players, having a convenient prayer bonus and a special attack which can be used to quickly dispose of the minions. Your other gear should include some sort of magic defence bonus. \nLeaving the lair will result in Sarachnis recovering all her health. \n\nUpon Sarachnis' death, all her spawns will die as well.

Players should take caution when fighting Saradomin wizards as they will change attack styles if protection [[prayer]]s are used.\n\nSimilar to [[Cave slime]], they will almost always [[poison]] the player when fought if [[Protect from Melee]] is not activated.\n\n==Strategy==\nSaradomin wizards have a somewhat low [[Defence]], so [[melee]] or [[Ranged]] is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level.\n\nFor players using Ranged or a [[halberd]], they may be able to make use of nearby obstacles to attack the Saradomin wizard, as the wizard will exclusively use Magic if safespotted and the player can activate [[Protect from Magic]] to negate all damage.\n\nAnother method for Ranged users is to run away and cause the player to leave the Saradomin wizard's patrol zone, causing the wizard to wander around aimlessly; the player can then safely dispatch the wizard from afar.\n\nMelee users should either wear armour resistant to melee and activate Protect from Magic '''OR''' wear armour resistant to Magic and activate Protect from Melee. Players who have a low Magic level should use the former method as a player's Magic level heavily influences their resistance to Magic attacks.\n\nIf Protect from Melee is not being used, a form of [[antipoison]] is recommended as the player will ''almost always'' become poisoned.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=589317}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=60|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=189|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=42|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=126|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=79|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=86|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=107|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=51|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fire rune|Quantity=180|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=25|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=28|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=30|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=9|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=10|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=45|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=8|Rarity=12/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=77|Rarity=17/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=89|Rarity=25/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=240|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Interestingly, the Saradomin wizard can cast Saradomin Strike while wielding a dragon dagger, even though players can only cast the spell while wielding a [[Saradomin staff]]. This trait is also shared by [[Saradomin priest]]s.\n*Surprisingly, there is a rare effect that enables the wizard to sometimes inflict poison when using Saradomin Strike, even if he does not use melee at all throughout the fight. This is actually caused by the mechanic that the wizard uses to poison the player. If the wizard is in melee range and the player is not using [[Protect from Melee]], the wizard has about a 95% chance of causing poison for each game tick that passes. The first game tick could fail, for example, but the poison might be inflicted on the second or third tick. Activating Protect from Melee prevents this from happening by causing the wizard to use Magic instead.\n*It's possible to imitate a Saradomin wizard by wearing [[desert shirt]] and [[desert robe|robe]], [[yellow cape]], [[dragon dagger|dragon dagger (p++)]] and [[leather boots]] while having the default avatar head characteristics.\n*If the player manages to hide from a Saradomin wizard and digs again in the correct coordinate spot, another wizard will appear.\n\n{{Treasure Trails}}\n[[Category:Saradominists]]",

She is able to inflict a single hit of 254 damage on the [[Wise Old Man]], leaving him incapacitated.

Her draining attack drains '''over''' 20 [[Prayer points]] at once. In any case, bringing [[Prayer potion]]s is advised.\n\nThe Sea Troll Queen attacks using [[Melee]] ([[crush]]) and, more often, a magic projectile resembling [[Water Wave]], with the latter being her more powerful attack. The Sea Troll Queen cannot move during the fight, and instead reverts to her prayer-draining ability should the player remain outside of melee distance with an overhead prayer active.\n\n''Generally, ''the best way to deal with the Sea Troll Queen is to use [[Protect from Magic]] and tank the melee attacks in order to prevent the occurrence of prayer drains. Conversely, fighting her at range should only be attempted by players who are prepared to use many prayer potions or withstand powerful magic attacks.\n\nThe Sea Troll Queen's most prominent weaknesses are [[stab]] and [[ranged]] attacks. She is most resistant to magic attacks due to having a very high magic level. Therefore, it is advantageous to plan your equipment accordingly before starting this section of the quest.

The shades in the Stronghold of Security are found next to the ladder leading to the current floor alongside a [[Zombie (Sepulcher of Death)|zombie]], while the ones in the Catacombs of Kourend are found in the northernmost area of Reeking Cove, south from the [[steel dragon]]s. It is worth noting that combat experience gained while fighting the shades in the Stronghold of Security is drastically reduced; the player will gain 1 experience for 10 damage dealt.\n\nAs shades are [[undead]], they are affected by the [[Salve amulet]] and [[Crumble Undead]]. They are also extremely weak to the [[Gadderhammer]], although a [[dragon scimitar]] deals more damage on average.\n\nThey are generally regarded as a terrible way to complete the \"Shades\" [[slayer task]] due to their high damage and high hitpoints (the better choice being [[Loar Shades]] in [[Mort'ton]]), with the only notable drops being shade robe pieces, which have little practicality.\n\nShades in the Stronghold of Security can be [[safespot]]ted using a skeleton found on the eastern side in the middle northern part of the room. They also have reduced experience rates, amounting to 4 experience per [[Slayer]] kill.\n\nShades in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]] can be safespotted by using a corner in the area just south of the Steel Dragons. However, to access them, a method for getting past multiple types of dragons or [[Twisted Banshee]]s is required.\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[random event]] update in [[2014]], the shade used to appear randomly when burying [[bones]]. On appearance, it would say \"Leave this place!\".

His attempts at creating a war between [[Misthalin]] and the [[Dorgeshuun]] were thwarted, and he was dismissed for treason by [[Duke Horacio]].\n\n==Death to the Dorgeshuun==\nDuring the [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]] quest, it is revealed by a [[Humans Against Monsters|H.A.M]] member that Sigmund and [[Johanhus Ulsbrecht]], head of H.A.M, are 'planning something big'. After eavesdropping on the H.A.M council, it is discovered that they are using a machine they bought from the dwarves of [[Keldagrim]] for unknown purposes. Once the dead Dorgeshuun [[Zanik]] has been revived, she reveals that the H.A.M are going to use the machine to flood the [[Dorgeshuun]] capital, [[Dorgesh-Kaan]]. After infiltrating the caves with the machine in it and slaying the H.A.M helpers, the player and Zanik battle the level 50 Sigmund. Using a [[ring of life]], he escapes death and swears that they will meet again. The ring works even if you reduce his [[Hitpoints]] to 0.\n\nDuring this battle, the player discovers Sigmund is a [[Saradomin]]ist; he uses a [[protection prayer]] called up by the powers of Saradomin.\n\n=== Combat Strategy ===\nSigmund is rather simple to defeat. First, players must defeat his cronies. Afterwards, both the player and [[Zanik]] can focus on Sigmund alone. Sigmund, probably out of spite of Zanik, will use [[Protect from Missiles]] rather than the [[protection prayer]] against whatever [[combat style]] you use, thus making him vulnerable.\n\n==Another Slice of H.A.M.==\nIn this quest, Sigmund and his men ambush [[goblin]]s at the [[Goblin Village]]. After a brief struggle, he captures [[Zanik]] and ties her to the new rail line linking [[Keldagrim]] and [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] in the hopes of starting war between the two cities. However, his plans are foiled by an adventurer who defeats him and manages to get Zanik off the track just before the train arrives.\n\n===Combat Strategy===\nThis time, Sigmund is slightly harder to defeat. [[Zanik]] will not be able to help you, and his combat level has increased from level 50 to level 64 since the last encounter. He will activate protection prayers depending on which combat style the player attacks with.\n\n==Pickpocketing==\nA successful pickpocket attempt will gain the following loot:\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLineThieving|Name=Key (The Lost Tribe)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=p>Only during [[The Lost Tribe]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}{{#set:Thieving level=13}}\n{{Reflist|group=p}}\n\n{{Another Slice of H.A.M.}}\n{{Humans Against Monsters}}\n{{The Lost Tribe}}\n{{Death to the Dorgeshuun}}\n{{Pickpocket}}\n{{Lumbridge}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Saradominists]]",

They are found at the end of the [[Asgarnian Ice Dungeon]]. Like other [[wyverns]], they require an [[elemental shield]], [[mind shield]], [[dragonfire shield]], [[dragonfire ward]], or [[ancient wyvern shield]] to reduce damage from their icy breath; however, it is not required to be slain. They are also the only monster that drops [[granite legs]].\n\nAlthough it is insinuated in [[Tarn's diary|Tarn's journal]] that Skeletal Wyverns are [[undead]], they are in fact re-animated remains, whereas actual undead creatures have come back to life. This causes the [[Salve amulet]] and its enchanted versions to '''not''' work against them.\n\nSkeletal Wyverns are assigned by the [[Slayer master]]s [[Chaeldar]], [[Konar]], [[Nieve]], and [[Duradel]]. Because an elemental shield or better is required to defend against their icy breath, they will '''only''' assign them if the player has completed the [[Elemental Workshop I]] [[quest]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1039948185337257989|date=12 September 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/CBLKu|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=No, wyverns are not assigned unless one's done that quest.}}\n\nUnlike the wyverns that reside within [[Fossil Island]], Skeletal Wyverns do '''not''' drop the [[wyvern visage]]; rather, they drop the [[draconic visage]].\n\n==Combat==\n{{main|Skeletal Wyvern/Strategies}}\nSkeletal Wyverns have high [[Defence]], [[Attack]], and [[Hitpoints]], thus making them very challenging opponents. They attack with [[Melee]], [[Ranged]], or their unique ice-breath attack. This attack can freeze players similar to the [[Ancient Magicks]]' [[ice spells]], with the addition of preventing the player from retaliating back for the duration of the freeze and reducing the player's stats. However, players may still eat food or drink potions while frozen.\u00a0Players can wield an [[Ancient wyvern shield|ancient]], [[mind shield|mind]], [[elemental shield|elemental]], or [[dragonfire shield]]/[[Dragonfire ward|ward]] to negate the wyverns' ice breath's stat reduction as well as lowering its max hit to 10. The ancient wyvern shield also makes the player immune to the freezing effect of the icy breath. [[Armour]] does not affect the accuracy of the ice-breath attack; the ice-breath will hit through all types of armour.\n\n[[Protect from Missiles]] is the suggested [[prayer]] to use against them due to the amount of range damage skeletal wyverns do, although it is not needed if you can [[safespot]] them.\n\nAs the wyverns are [[draconic creatures]], [[dragonbane weapons]] such as the [[dragon hunter lance]] (on the pound/slash stance, as wyverns' stab defence is rather high) and the [[dragon hunter crossbow]] are the best choices to kill them swiftly.\nDue to their moderate melee defence, melee is recommended to kill wyverns, unless the player's [[Defence]] level is low. If killing wyverns with melee, an [[abyssal whip]] or other high-accuracy [[slash]] weapon is recommended. Wyverns are slightly weak to [[Magic]].\n\n[[File:Skeletal Wyvern door safespot.png|thumb|300px|The most popular way of [[safespotting]] Wyverns is done by trapping the eastern or western one on the side of the cave entrance after losing [[aggression]], as shown.]]\n[[File:Skeletal Wyvern (upper level) safespot.png|thumb|297x297px|Safespot for task-only area.]]\nWyverns can be [[safespotted]] in multiple ways. A common method for doing this is getting them stuck behind the main entrance. Players should always wait for the wyverns to become [[unaggressive]], which takes 10 minutes, before attempting this; otherwise, they'll get hit by other wyverns when trying to safespot another. A good method to make them unaggressive is to wait in front of the main entrance for ten to twenty minutes; this will make the wyverns unaggressive near the entrance. Players who do this should be careful not to walk more than a few steps deeper into the cave, as if they do, the wyverns will get [[aggressive]] again. Alternatively, for safespotting, players can bring a few [[prayer potion]]s and attack the wyvern from seven steps away with [[Protect from Range]] on.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Asgarnian Ice Dungeon]]\n**Asgarnian Ice Dungeon upper level ([[Slayer task]] only)\n\n==Drops==\n<!--please go into source mode to add drops for new editors-->\n{{DropLogProject|kills=228591}}\n\nThe average skeletal wyvern kill, including its unique drops, is worth {{Coins|floor{{#vardefineecho:oneskelwyvernLoot|{{#expr:\n\n1/10000*{{GEP|Draconic visage}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:skelwyvernUniq|{{#expr:\n1/512*{{GEP|Dragon plateskirt}} +\n1/512*{{GEP|Dragon platelegs}} +\n1/512*{{GEP|Granite legs}}\n}}}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:skelwyvernReg|{{#expr:\n1 * {{GEP|Wyvern bones}} +\n(4/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Earth battlestaff}} +\n(3/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune axe}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune battleaxe}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune warhammer}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune full helm}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune kiteshield}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon platelegs}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon plateskirt}} +\n(1/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon med helm}} +\n(8/128) * 250 * {{GEP|Pure essence}} +\n(6/128) * 225 * {{GEP|Air rune}} +\n(4/128) * 150 * {{GEP|Water rune}} +\n(4/128) * 80 * {{GEP|Chaos rune}} +\n(4/128) * 45 * {{GEP|Law rune}} +\n(4/128) * 40 * {{GEP|Death rune}} +\n(4/128) * 25 * {{GEP|Blood rune}} +\n(1/128) * 20 * {{GEP|Soul rune}} +\n(5/128) * 36 * {{GEP|Rune arrow}} +\n(3/128) * 87 * {{GEP|Adamant bolts}} +\n(3/128) * 39.5 * {{GEP|Runite bolts}} +\n(2/128) * 3 * {{GEP|Ranarr seed}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Snapdragon seed}} +\n(7/128) * 2 * {{HerbDTValue}} +\n(6/128) * 35 * {{GEP|Magic logs}} +\n(6/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Adamantite bar}} +\n(3/128) * 200 * {{GEP|Iron ore}} +\n(3/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Battlestaff}} +\n(2/128) * 75 * {{GEP|Unpowered orb}} +\n(2/128) * 10 * {{GEP|Uncut ruby}} +\n(2/128) * 5 * {{GEP|Uncut diamond}} +\n(12/128) * 300 * 1 +\n(8/128) * 6 * {{GEP|Lobster}} +\n(7/128) * 2 * {{GEP|Prayer potion(4)}} +\n(2/128) * 1 * {{GEP|Runite crossbow (u)}} +\n(3/128) * 1 * {{RDTValue}}\n}}}}\n}} }}\n\n}}.

Players are required to run past them during the [[Monkey Madness I]] quest in order to reach [[Zooknock]]. Players are advised to use [[Protect from Melee]] against these monsters, as they attack accurately and can easily overwhelm with their sheer numbers.\n\nThey are aggressive to all players who are not using a [[greegree]] to turn themselves into a monkey.\n\nTheir tendency to cluster around a player means that they are often a popular choice for players powertraining [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Players who have access to [[Maniacal monkey]]s should kill them instead as these skeletons do not have any drops to mitigate supply costs.\n\nIt is worth noting that these skeletons have the tendency of spawning from the bones they drop. To prevent an overflow of extra skeletons, they will disappear into a pile of burning bones after a short while. When they respawn, they do so with an animation of them coming out of the ground, this is unique among other monsters. The bones cannot be taken away from [[Ape Atoll]], and when [[teleport]]ing out a message appears saying 'The skeleton bones you are carrying crumble to dust'. Ashes are then left in your inventory.\n==Strategies==\n===Ranged===\n\nAs stated previously, skeleton monkeys provide excellent Ranged experience rates when attacked with chinchompas of any kind. High ranged bonus is advisable to reduce the amount of failed attacks. '''It should be advised that upon [[death]], ALL chinchompas will be lost, and they will not be retrievable upon death.

Accessing its lair requires the use of a [[dark totem]] on the altar found in the centre of the Catacombs; one dark totem permits only one attempt, which makes it a [[Sporadic bosses|sporadic boss]].\n\nSkotizo can be substituted for both [[Black demon]] and [[Greater demon]] kills during Slayer tasks.\n\n==History==\nSkotizo was a general of [[Zamorak]] during the [[God Wars]], but he was often outshined by Zamorak's more notable generals, such as [[Thammaron]] and [[K'ril Tsutsaroth]]. He is also [[Zalcano]]'s brother.\n\nAfter he and his soldiers' cunning at the Battle of [[Carrallangar]], Zamorak personally gave them their next mission, something he rarely did. The mission was to lead an expedition to recover a certain artefact in the [[Karamjan Temple]] found within the [[Kharazi Jungle]]. Skotizo was delighted by being assigned the mission and set out as soon as possible to please his god.\n\nReaching the Temple after a few days, Skotizo and his squad had managed to reach the Temple's centre after navigating a large maze. Now in possession of the artefact, Skotizo betrayed his squad, taking the artefact's power for himself and decimating the expedition team. Zamorak held Zalcano responsible for Skotizo's treachery, cursing her to turn into stone until she brings her brother before him.\n\nSkotizo managed to avoid Zamorak's wrath and travelled to [[Great Kourend]], where he used the artefact to summon a large variety of monsters, creating what is known today as the [[Catacombs of Kourend]]. Skotizo remained in the large chamber underneath the catacombs; roughly 200 years after the Kourend civil war, he encountered and killed an adventurer who stumbled into his chamber while investigating mysterious disappearances.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=18964}}\n\nSkotizo will always drop one ancient shard, with a rare chance to drop an additional 1-4{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1277951091003588611|date=30 June 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/7hHjO|archivedate=24 July 2020}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!{{Plinkp|Ancient shard}}\n!Chance\n|-\n|1\n|75%\n|-\n|2\n|15%\n|-\n|3\n|5%\n|-\n|4\n|4%\n|-\n|5\n|1%\n|}\n{{Average drop value}}\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ashes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ancient shard|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune platebody|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune platelegs|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune plateskirt|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=500|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=450|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=450|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy snapdragon|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy torstol|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut dragonstone|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=1/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Battlestaff|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Onyx bolt tips|Quantity=40|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamantite ore|Quantity=75 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bar|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw anglerfish|Quantity=60 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mahogany plank|Quantity=150 (noted)|Rarity=7/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut onyx|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Shield left half|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/100}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark claw|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/25|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|321}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Skotos|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/65|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark totem|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|gemw=No|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1255582408155566082|date=29 April 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/aHpOE|archivedate=29 April 2020|quote=[Could you tell us the drop rate of a Dark totem from Skotizo?] Looks like 1/128 from this code.}}}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Jar of darkness|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/2500}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Catacombs tertiary===\n{{CatacombsDropTable|hitpoints=450|quantity=1-4}}<!-- This is extra shard drops; you can get 5 total, including the guaranteed 1.

He uses both [[melee]] and [[ranged]] attacks. It is vital to have [[Relicym's balm]] or [[Sanfew serum]], and at least [[swordfish]] or better when fighting him, as the [[disease]] can drain stats by up to 15. He is very difficult as he can drain your [[prayer]] and switch between devastating range and powerful melee. However, it is possible to use [[magic]] or [[ranged]] from behind the stand or a stack of bones, and then he can only damage the player using range.\n\n[[Brutal arrow]]s and the [[Crumble Undead]] spell are his weakness. Other attacks, such as melee, will be futile, as they can only hit up to 25% of the normal max hit (for example, up to 5 if a player normally hits up to 20) on Slash Bash. Taking too long to kill Slash Bash will cause him to disappear, forcing a player to fight him again.\n\nIt is possible to safespot him using brutal arrows or Crumble Undead spell. Using [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer with this method will reduce the damage taken to 0. \n\n==Zogre Flesh Eaters==\nHe plays a short but important role in the quest [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]]. When the Ogres find out that the [[zogre]] curse is irreversible, they decide to make their sacred burial ground in another spot, but for it to be sacred, the hero must retrieve the ancient sacred [[Ogre artefact|artefact]] that was left behind in the [[Jiggig|Zogre Caves]].

The room is beyond the two stone doors, and down a set of stairs; it contains some intimidating monsters.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Slash Bash appears to be wearing the artefact you are sent to retrieve on his head, which explains why he drops it when he dies.\n* Slash Bash might be a reference to the {{WP|PlayStation (console)|PSX}} game \"Crash Bash\".\n\n{{Zogre Flesh Eaters}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Ogres]]\n[[Category:Undead]]\n[[Category:Bandosians]]",

He is capable of using a highly lethal form of [[Ice Barrage]], although when the player fights him he attacks exclusively with much weaker [[melee]]. He can also cast [[Teleother Camelot]], which he forcibly uses on the player (the player has no option to cancel).\n\n==Background==\nPrior to beginning the [[Wanted!]] quest, Solus was already widely known as the \"murder mage\", due to the fact that he was a mass murderer. He had managed to elude the authorities for so long due to his incredible [[magic]]al abilities, as he had enough skill to be able to slow down the process of teleportation enough that he was literally in three places at once- the point from which he teleported, the [[Abyss]] and also the destination of his teleport spell. He was also capable of greatly increasing the damage that could be done by the [[Flames of Zamorak]] spell, allowing him to cripple even the strongest player. Fortunately, Solus was captured at some point by the [[Temple Knights]] and was kept their prisoner until recently.\n\n==Release into society==\nWhen the player originally [[Recruitment Drive|joined the Temple Knights]], [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] had failed to go through the proper method of recruitment, and so in order for the player to progress up the ranks of Temple Knight, they were required to join the [[White Knights]]. In order to do this a crisis was needed, and so it was arranged for the release of Solus Dellagar in the hope that the player, along with the Temple Knights, would be able to recapture him.\n\n==Death==\nBy using secret Temple Knight technology, the player was able to track Solus to the [[Black Knights|Kinshra]] headquarters and then the [[Zamorak]]ian shrine in [[Varrock]]. Eventually the player managed to trap him at the rune essence mine. A squad of Temple Knight archers arrived to take Solus into custody, but he was able to defeat them all in a single blow, leaving just the player to fight. This leaves him fairly exhausted and vulnerable, which causes him to be eventually slain, leaving only his hat as proof of his death. Taking the hat in allows the player to fully join the ranks of the Temple Knights.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wanted!]]\n*[[Temple Knights]]\n\n{{Wanted!}}\n[[Category:Monsters with no combat level]]\n[[Category:Zamorakians]]",

It is the fourth encounter in the [[Theatre of Blood]].\n\n==Mechanics==\nSotetseg stands immobile in the northern section of a 14\u00d715 tiled arena. It launches small red projectiles which can be blocked with [[Protect from Magic]]. Upon striking a player, these projectiles will ricochet towards other players as small grey projectiles, which can be blocked with [[Protect from Missiles]]. Failing to protect against Sotetseg's attacks will block the player's prayer for 3 seconds.\n[[File:Sotetseg_Shadow_Realm.png|thumb|left|280px|A player dragged into the [[Shadow Realm]] by Sotetseg.]]\nSotetseg will also occasionally fire a large red projectile at a single player. All players must stand within a 3\u00d73 area of the targeted player to disperse the damage; failing to do so will result in targeted player taking up to 121 damage. Correct prayer protection must also be applied.\n\nAt 66.6% and 33.3% hitpoints, Sotetseg will choose a single player and transport them into the shadow realm. The player must follow the red path on the tiled ground and click on the portal to return to the arena. The transported player will also constantly take hits of 3 damage while in the realm. The players in the arena must also follow the same path, however, they will only be able to see the current location of the transported player, denoted by a red glow on the tiled ground. Concurrently, players in the arena will also be chased by a red vortex that will deal damage to the whole party if intercepted.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=6800}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Change|date=21 June 2018|update=Theatre of Blood Changes & Deadman Summer Finals|poll=|change=The large ball of energy attack now has the same timing regardless of the player's distance from the boss and the message notifying of it is now highlighted, and the magical and ranged attacks can no longer stack on the player on the same game tick.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSotetseg the blood beast work-in-progress.png|A work in progress model of Sotetseg\nSotetseg the blood beast model.gif|Sotetseg's completed model\nSotetseg artwork.jpg|Artwork of Sotetseg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"S\u00f6t\u00e9ts\u00e9g\" means \"darkness\" in Hungarian.\n\n{{Theatre of Blood}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]",

However, the voice of [[Lord Iban|Iban]] drove them insane. [[Koftik]] fell for this \"voice\" during [[Underground Pass (quest)|Underground Pass]].\n\nApparently, the victims of Iban are all locked into cages, being subjected to Iban's voice until they deteriorate to become the [[half-souless|half-soulless]]. They are seen as still visibly human, rocking back and forth with extremely pale skin. From here, they deteriorate further into \"Soulless\", though we don't actually see this process.\n\nSoulless are aggressive to low/medium levelled players and [[retreat]] when they have low health. They drop nothing beside bones.\n\n==Habitat==\nThey are found in the Underground Pass. They dwell at the bottom of the chasm, below the cages where the [[Half-soulless]] are kept and found around [[Underground Pass (dungeon)#Part 4|Iban's temple]].\n\n==Training purposes==\nSoulless can be used for training as they have high Hitpoints and very low accuracy, low defence as well as low strength. It is quite easy to dispatch one in one blow. The fact that they will often retreat makes them perfect for players using a multicannon as the cannon will shoot at all soulless in the area without you being attacked by other soulless and having combat interrupted causing the cannon to target the enemy attacking you. The downside of this method is the fact that they reside in a remote location and they drop nothing but bones.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In-game, they used to be referred to as \"Souless\", which was a typo.

There are four types of Spiritual warriors: [[Saradomin]]ist, [[Zamorak]]ian, [[Bandos]]ian, and [[Armadyl]]ian. Spiritual warriors require 68 [[Slayer]] to kill (note Spiritual creatures cannot be given as a [[Slayer task]] if the player has not completed the [[Death Plateau]] quest). Just like [[Spiritual ranger]]s and [[Spiritual mages]], there are Spiritual warriors from each god.\n\nSpiritual warriors frequently drop [[mithril equipment]], [[adamant equipment]] and [[rune equipment]], so it is advisable to bring runes for [[High Level Alchemy]].\n\nFor players killing Spiritual warriors as part of a [[Slayer task]] wanting to avoid being attacked by them, the main area contains Saradominist warriors who are often engaged in combat with other monsters.\n\n==Locations==\n\n*[[God Wars Dungeon]]:\n**[[Saradomin]], [[Armadyl]], [[Zamorak]] and [[Bandos]] bases\n**Main area (Saradomin only)\n*Saradomin, Armadyl, Zamorak and Bandos \"outposts\" of the [[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon]]\n\n==Strategy==\nA good place to kill Spiritual warriors is just outside of the Zamorak Boss chamber as there are plenty of them. 70 [[Hitpoints]] are required to access the [[Zamorak]] base, and the player's prayer points will be completely drained upon entering. There are [[safespots]] (piles of stones) inside the Zamorak base, which can be used to safely kill Spiritual warriors with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]].\n\nAs with all other Armadylean monsters, the Armadyl variant can only be attacked with Ranged or Magic. They also use Ranged instead of melee to attack.\n\nThe Armadylean variant is '''not''' considered an [[Aviansie]] for the purposes of a [[Slayer task]], even though when the player attempts to attack one with melee a message in the player's chatbox appears saying \"The Aviansie is flying too high for you to attack using melee.\"\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=63141}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Spiritual warrior}}\n===Weapons===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron scimitar|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=15/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=5/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=7/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black dagger|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril spear(p)|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune halberd|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/127}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Leather gloves|Quantity=1|Rarity=9/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=11/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=18/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Black kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Iron plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/127}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/127}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Gem drop table===\n{{GemDropTable|4/127}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=wildygwd>Only dropped by those found in the [[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ecumenical key|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/60|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=wildygwd/>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>1/64 if a [[Ring of wealth (i)]] is worn and fought in the [[Wilderness]].</ref>|AltRarity=1/64|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Wilderness Slayer tertiary===\n{{WildernessSlayerDropTable|combat=115|hitpoints=98|combatmax=134|hitpointsmax=131|altraritydash=yes|slayerbonus=yes}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=8 August 2019|update=Smithing and Silver Crafting Interfaces|change=The drop rate for [[ecumenical key]]s have been changed to be 1/60 regardless of keys owned.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*On release, Spiritual warriors dropped medium clue scrolls, but were updated to drop hard instead. The Armadylean Spiritual warriors also hit very low and had inaccurate attacks, this was later fixed.\n*Zamorakian warriors appear to have a Gnome/Glarial's amulet (similar to the crystal pendant which the player receives in the quest [[Regicide]]). Their weapons resemble an [[anger mace]] from the [[A Soul's Bane]] [[Quests|quest]]. Also, the armour they are wearing looks like a red version of [[Dharok's platebody]] and [[Dharok's platelegs|legs]].\n*Zamorakian warriors seem to have a graphical glitch where their hands do not seem to be gripping the handle of their weapons correctly, as their hands seem to be too far down the handle.\n*Zamorakian spiritual warriors appear to have another glitch. They seem to be holding their maces through their bodies.\n*Spiritual creatures are blocked by 113,241 players and were the most blocked slayer monster in 2017.\n*Since release both Saradomin and Zamorakian spiritual warriors attacked their enemies by punching at them despite carrying a weapon.

They reside in the [[Wyvern Cave]] on [[Fossil Island]] and are the weakest of the [[Fossil Island wyvern]]s. Like other [[Wyverns]], they require an [[elemental shield]], [[mind shield]], [[dragonfire shield]], [[dragonfire ward]] or [[ancient wyvern shield]] to be equipped while fighting them, otherwise the player will suffer devastating damage from their unique icy breath.\n\nUnlike their [[Skeletal Wyvern|Skeletal]] variant, Spitting Wyverns can use their icy breath from any distance. They will use [[Ranged]] when attacking from a distance, and will not try to use [[Melee]] unless the target is in melee range. Their Ranged attack is weak; however, it may hit the player multiple times if it is a [[successful hit]].\n\nIf on a [[Slayer task]], it is highly recommended that you kill this variant of Fossil Island wyvern because of its slow ranged attack speed and relatively low hits when it successfully lands this attack. \n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=95043}}\n\n{{Average drop value|mob=Spitting Wyvern}}\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wyvern bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/123}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Battlestaff|Quantity=3-5 (noted)|Rarity=3/123}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant battleaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/123}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/122}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/123}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant platebody|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/123}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Granite longsword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Maz|url=https://twitter.com/JagexMaz/status/922722786359037953|date=24 October 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/vpmfG|archivedate=25 March 2019|quote=Fossil Island info!

They will bounce towards the fort and detonate, causing big damage to all players, monsters, and objects in the immediate vicinity. This will also happen if they are killed.\n\nKilling them is a higher priority the closer they get to the gates, as their detonations can damage the gates. Splatters will '''never''' attack the [[Void Knight]], and if killed near it, no damage would be dealt to the Void Knight.\n\nSplatter detonations can be used strategically akin to a [[Void seal]] by causing them to detonate near large groups of monsters. This '''does''' work on portals. [[Protection prayers]] do not prevent the damage. Players using [[Dharok's equipment]] may wish to be in range of a detonation in order to lower their health quickly.\n\nSplatters are not affected by [[Brawler]] impassibility.\n\n==Pest Control==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Level\n!Hit points\n!Max hit\n!Colour\n!Novice\n!Intermediate\n!Veteran\n|-\n|22||13||3||Light orange||{{Yes}}||{{No}}||{{No}}\n|-\n|33||23||3||Pink||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}||{{No}}\n|-\n|44||33||4||Light green||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}\n|-\n|54||43||4||Red-orange||{{No}}||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}\n|-\n|65||53||5||Blue||{{No}}||{{No}}||{{Yes}}\n|}\n\n{{Pest Control}}",

Steel dragons are the fourth strongest [[Metal dragons|metallic dragons]], behind [[mithril dragon|mithril]], [[adamant dragon|adamant]] and [[rune dragon]]s. They have a chance of dropping the\u00a0[[draconic visage]], which is the motivation of many steel dragon killers. Like their fellow metallic brethren, steel dragons can use long-range dragonfire in addition to using melee. The steel dragon boasts a higher max hit and accuracy compared to the [[iron dragon]], although it is far weaker than a mithril dragon.\n\nWhen given a task of steel dragons for [[Slayer]], they can be an extremely hard and long task for unprepared players. The cheapest way for players to kill them are using bolt spells with [[chaos gauntlet]]s to increase damage. Players can also use a [[slayer's staff (e)]] and [[Magic Dart]]. Alternatively, players can use ranged with an imbued slayer helmet to cover up lost accuracy against the dragon's high ranged defence. Higher levelled players can use the [[Zamorakian hasta]] or [[trident of the seas]]/[[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] to kill steel dragons.\n\nThey drop [[rune items]] frequently and have an increased chance of dropping\u00a0[[dragon platelegs]] and [[dragon plateskirt]]s over their weaker metal counterparts (being the\u00a0[[Iron dragon|iron]] and\u00a0[[bronze dragon]]s). The\u00a0[[runite limbs]], [[rune axe|axes]] and\u00a0[[rune mace|maces]] generate quite a nice sum of [[coin]]s when [[High Level Alchemy|high-alched]] to conserve inventory space.\n\nPlayers can pick up the [[steel bars]] they drop to make profit, as they drop 5 at a time. However, this is unviable because players will need to bank after 4-5 kills which can hamper kill rates. Even with the completion of the [[Elite Karamja Diary]], which notes their steel bars in the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]], it is somewhat impractical here as they are surrounded by many iron dragons.\n\nIf they are fought without complete [[Dragonfire|dragonfire protection]], it is recommended to stay in melee range and use [[Protect from Melee]], to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken.\n\nOne Steel dragon is fought during [[Dragon Slayer II]].\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Brimhaven Dungeon]] (13 spawns)\n**4 spawns in the main area of the dungeon, with an additional 9 spawns in a task-only area\n*{{TL}}[[Catacombs of Kourend]] (2 spawns)\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel bar|Quantity=5|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Steel bars are dropped in [[bank note]] form if players have completed the [[Karamja Diary]] and are killing steel dragons in the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dragon>The drop rate is 1/512 for a specific legging, or 1/256 for any legging.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dragon />}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune dart(p)|Quantity=12|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune mace|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant kiteshield|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune knife|Quantity=7|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune axe|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=20|Rarity=19/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune javelin|Quantity=7|Rarity=20/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bolts|Quantity=2-12|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Soul rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Coins===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=470|Rarity=17/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=650|Rarity=5/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Only dropped if [[Monkey Madness II]] isn't completed.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super attack(3)|Quantity=1|Rarity=13/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite limbs|Quantity=1|Rarity=8/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon javelin heads|Quantity=12|Rarity=5/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Dragon javelin heads are only dropped after completion of [[Monkey Madness II]].</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Runite bar|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super defence(2)|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curry|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curry|Quantity=2|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Rare and Gem drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox|4/128|4/128|naturetalisman=yes}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (hard)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/64|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|246}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped if killed on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|AltRarity={{Brimstone rarity|274}}|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/500|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Catacombs tertiary===\n{{CatacombsDropTable|hitpoints=250|catacombsonly=yes|versionname=Catacombs of Kourend}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon plateskirt|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dmm>The drop rate is 1/128 for a specific dragon legging, or 1/64 for any dragon legging.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon platelegs|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=dmm />|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Draconic visage|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n{{Dragon}}\n{{Brimhaven Dungeon}}",

He wields a poisoned [[dragon dagger]].\n\nThe moment at which the stranger appears depends on when you first receive each diamond; the game will wait 5 to 10 minutes after the player receives a diamond and then will consider spawning him. However, the 5-10 mins is based on farming ticks. It is possible to for the stranger to spawn in zero time from receiving a diamond.  If the game chooses not to on that occasion, he will not spawn at all for that diamond at any point in the future. He will not appear if; you're in a place where he shouldn't appear such as the boss area of the quest, you don't have any diamonds in your inventory, or you have killed him.{{CiteGeneral |url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1217091130564792327|title=Could the stranger appear more than once if he is not killed (with diamonds in inventory)? |author=Mod Ash |date=14 Jan 2020 |accessdate=January 14 2020 |publisher=Twitter |quote=When you first receive each diamond, the game waits 5-10 mins and then considers spawning him. If it chooses not to on that occasion, it will not retry for that diamond:\n- You're in a place where he shouldn't appear, e.g. the boss areas of the quest\n- No diamond.\n- You killed him }} He can appear right after a diamond is obtained, which can be dangerous as the player may be depleted of supplies. The more diamonds the player has, the greater the chance for him to appear.\n\nNotably, the stranger is capable of using the dragon dagger's [[special attacks|special attack]] repeatedly, and more often than a player can. He may potentially land two special attacks in successive ticks - players unable to use [[Protect from Melee]] or have low-level armour should avoid him at all costs. He does not seem to be limited to a special attack bar like a player is, and his attack speed varies throughout the fight.\n\nHe has an unusual mechanic, where he will follow the player closest to him. This may also happen while he is in combat with the target player. However, he cannot be attacked by players not doing the [[Desert Treasure]] quest. Attempting to do so will yield a message, stating: \"''He has no interest in fighting you.''\" Casting any form of magic on him will lead to a similar message to appear, which says: \"''He's not after you...''\".\n\nWhen he appears, he says \"''You are not worthy holding that Diamond of Blood/Ice/Shadow/Smoke!''\"\n\nIf the player kills him, a chat window will pop up with them asking themselves \"''I wonder what that was all about?''\"\n\n[[File:Stranger.gif|left|frame|A player fighting the stranger.

He subsequently claimed the stranger was actually an assassin sent by Sir Tiffy to prevent the release of Azzanadra, but whether or not he was serious is unknown. Sir Tiffy was not added to the game until over two months after Desert Treasure's release. {{CiteGeneral |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4hha91/i_used_to_work_on_rs_ask_me_selected_things/d2pos0v/|title=I used to work on RS, Ask Me Selected Things? |author=Mod James |date=2 May 2016 |accessdate=October 6 2018 |publisher=Reddit |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/EvqUS |archivedate= October 6 2018 |quote=This falls squarely into the \"foreshadowing future stuff I never got round to\" category XD He's a Temple Knight assassin dispatched personally by Sir Tiffy to prevent Azzanadras release - what WHAT???}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Desert Treasure}}",

Despite their fearsome nature, they have a peaceful relationship with the [[Moon Clan]], but are aggressive to outsiders, effectively serving as guards.\n\nSuqah can be a good [[slayer task]], due to the relatively high amount of [[experience]] per hour that can be gained from killing them with the help of a [[dwarf multicannon]]. However, with the use of a dwarf multicannon and prayer potions, it will also result in a loss of coins due to the lack of valuable drops.\n\nThe Suqah on the northern part of the island attack with magic, using a weak version of [[Ice Barrage]] or [[Water Wave]], in addition to melee. It is recommended to use [[Protect from Magic]] and gear with high melee defences, as well as bringing some food, when fighting these Suqah.\n\nSuqah are also located on the southern part of the island, albeit more sparsely. These do not attack with magic, therefore making it a good spot for players assigned Suqah as a slayer task that do not wish to use the Protect from Magic prayer; their damage can be mitigated entirely with [[Protect from Melee]].\u00a0There is a [[safespot]] next to the tree closest to the [[Oneiromancer]], and standing on the bridge will also work.\u00a0A [[Seal of passage]] is required to use the bank located on the Lunar Isle if the player has not completed the [[Dream Mentor]] [[quest]].

A good tactic is to position the hostile terror dogs and animated steel armour behind Tarn so that only Tarn is able to attack the player.

He was the artisan that created the chambers.\n\n==History==\nBased on [[Tekton's journal|his journal]], Tekton was one of the few that was still loyal to [[Xeric]] after the majority of [[Great Kourend]] usurped him. He built many grand buildings to worship Xeric, though it is unknown if they are still around. He also believes he had a family and children, though their current status is unknown along with any potential descendants.\n\nHe oversaw the creation of the chambers under [[Mount Quidamortem]], in addition to creating a new temple. Xeric was pleased that Tekton gave him the ability to use cave magic, but was disappointed when everyone else began using it, especially the \"[[Vasa Nistirio|nasty high priest]]\". Xeric ordered him to destroy the temple, which he did, but only slightly in the event that Xeric changed his mind. Tekton tried to teach Xeric how to use the magic without the aid of the temple, but failed in this endeavor.\n\nXeric later took him into the caves and gave him immortality by putting his mind in a new, indestructible body, enchanting his anvil and teaching him now to repair his new body. While he gained a large amount of strength, Tekton soon noted he was unable to manipulate the crystals, though he believed that he wanted his strength, and not intelligence. After being made of by Xeric's companions, Tekton decided to stay inside Mount Quidamortem to protect and improve himself, waiting for the day Xeric returns.\n\n==Strategy==\nTekton is seen working with his magnetic anvil. As soon as someone gets near him, he will notice them and begin the fight. All players should use [[Protect from Melee]] when fighting Tekton, unless they are confident they can avoid his attacks. Protection prayers do not block all damage, but they mitigate it. He cannot be attacked when he is at his anvil.\n\nMagic and Ranged attacks are ineffective against Tekton. Although inaccurate, the [[Vulnerability]] spell can still be cast to lower his Defence by 10%. He has very high [[Defence]], so using a [[crush weapon]] is recommended against him. The [[elder maul]] is particularly useful against him due to its high accuracy.\n\nWhen he is moving, Tekton will apply rapid stomp damage to players under him. The pillars of smoke around his chamber will lightly damage players if they are on them.\n\nTekton will emit two different auras beneath him: orange, which is his non-enraged stance; and red, which is his enraged stance. Tekton's overall [[Defence]] is lower when he has an orange aura. He is enraged for approximately 15 seconds when returning from the anvil to attack players (except at the start of the fight) after which he reverts to his regular stance.\n\n[[File:Fighting Tekton.png|thumb|290px|A group of players facing Tekton.]]\n\nThe [[special attacks]] of [[dragon warhammer]] or [[Bandos godsword]] are very useful to lower Tekton's high defence as well, as they both have unique effects against Tekton:\n\n*If the dragon warhammer's special misses against Tekton, it will still drain 5% of his current Defence level.\n*If the Bandos godsword's special misses against Tekton, it will lower his Defence by 10 levels.\n\nUpon entering, players should all stand on the same space and lure him as far away from his anvil as possible. After being alerted to the team's presence, Tekton will move towards one player. He will stop when he reaches that player and starts attacking them. If a player attacks him he will also stop. Players should then attack and run in a counter-clockwise motion around him, attacking at each turning corner. If Tekton attacks and no players are within melee range of him, he will return to the anvil. Otherwise, he will continue attacking for a prolonged duration before returning back to the anvil. When Tekton returns to the anvil, he heals himself slightly and regenerates some of his lost Defence, and targets each player in the room with two sparks, dealing moderate damage within a 3x3 area. The flying sparks aim at where players are currently standing, so it is best to spread out and dodge the sparks by moving away from where you were standing. When he leaves the anvil, the targeted player should not move, or he will return to the anvil and heal again.\n\nAn alternative strategy is to step outside of his melee range between when he starts an attack and when it lands, and stepping back in his melee range to attack. When correctly timed, Tekton will continue attacking instead of retreating to his anvil. Players get a chance to attack every three [[RuneScape clock|ticks]], so the [[elder maul]] or [[godsword]]s are useful due to their six-tick attack speed.\n\nDue to Tekton being the first room in [[Chambers of Xeric/Challenge Mode|Challenge Mode]] raids, it is an ideal place to practice as the boss mechanics can be unforgiving to small mistakes.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tekton's journal|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Stinkhorn mushroom|Quantity=5|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Overload (+)(4)|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Prayer enhance (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Revitalisation (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Onyx|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/450|AltRarity=1/70|AltRarityDash=yes|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"A\">The drop rate depends on party size.</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n<references group=\"A\"/>\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=31 January 2019|update=Chambers of Xeric, Kebos, and Collection Log Changes|change=Tekton's defence was reduced by 25% to make it less dependent on defence draining special attacks.

Upon completion of the miniquest, more terror dogs will appear in the room the player battled Tarn Razorlor in.\n\nTerror dogs use an accurate melee attack. As the room they are fought in is a multi-combat area, fighting them can become very dangerous quickly, as multiple terror dogs can attack the player all at once.\n\nIt should be noted that, without a [[Slayer ring]], reaching the end of Tarn's lair is a time consuming and dangerous undertaking. Terror dogs do not count toward fulfilling a Slayer task for dogs; they are a separate task.\n\nThey are the only monsters that drop the [[Granite helm]]et.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Tarn's Lair]] (In the room where Tarn Razorlor is fought)\n\n==Strategy==\n'''Players can hide in Tarn's room just north of the terror dogs and wait for them to develop [[tolerance]] to the player. This makes combating them significantly less risky.''' Be sure to log out to check for tolerance, as any dogs aggressive towards the player will remain so until the player exits Tarn's room, even if all other dogs are no longer aggressive. This will also cause all dogs targeting the player to stop and begin wandering around. Players can check to see if the dogs are still aggressive by exiting Tarn's room and waiting at the door for a quick retreat if they are.\n\nTerror dogs are similar to [[hellhound]]s in that they can hit hard and accurately, but have very low [[Defence]]. Unlike hellhounds, multiple terror dogs can attack at once. Players should be aware that the room that terror dogs are in at Tarn's Lair will drain\u00a0[[prayer]]\u00a0at a rate of 1 point per two game ticks, or 50 points per minute (much faster than the\u00a0[[Barrows]]).\n\nFighting terror dogs (mostly done for Slayer tasks) can be a difficult task for players who are unprepared. They can be safespotted if standing in the recesses after they have became tolerant of players.

In order to fight the Draugen you must use your Hunter's talisman on the correct tile for him to appear. Depending on where it is found, it may be lured behind a tree stump and [[safespot]]ted. After a while it will teleport far from its last location, which gives the player the message in their chatbox \"The Draugen has moved elsewhere...\". A common strategy to find it quickly is by waiting in a specific location until it is nearby, usually by the river.

This boss is notable for giving the most points when it is defeated in hard mode.\u00a0\n\n==Strategy==\nThe most efficient way to defeat this boss is by wearing the best melee armour the player can equip alongside a staff or trident, as even if the player has a negative magic attack, they will still be able to hit often with Magic due to the boss having no Magic defence. The boss's Ranged attack is able to deal considerably more damage than its melee attack, so maintaining melee distance is advised at all times.\n\nThe boss will periodically summon Doubts which are seen as a distraction as killing them provides no real benefit to the player as all of them are automatically killed when the boss dies, and it may spawn more after the player manually kills them anyway. If necessary, the player can try positioning these Doubts behind the boss if they do not want to be under attack by them, although they are far more weaker than the boss in comparison and usually not a problem. Having auto-retaliate off is advised while eating food as it may cause the player to inadvertently attack the Doubts instead of the boss.\n\nPlayers who think they might have to escape the fight via the lectern should bear in mind that while running away they will be hit by multiple Ranged hits so it is advised the player does not have their inventory completely depleted when fleeing, to not risk the chance of dying while fleeing.\n\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n{{Dream Mentor}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

To stop this, players can freeze them with the help of [[Ice spells]] and then kill them while frozen.\n\nTo properly freeze all healers, only three Nylocas must be frozen early, the most western ones, two north, one south. Then prioritise northern third and second south few game ticks before they meet in the centre. Once there, the rest will be frozen in the same spot on the consecutive barrage, leaving a clutch of five for ice/blood barrage or chinchompas and three isolated ones. Causing multiple clutches will lead to few leaking to the boss.\n\nEvery Nylocas that reaches the boss will heal her for two times their remaining health and increase the damage of her basic tornado magic attacks.\n\nHer tornado attacks are magic based and will prioritise the closest player to her, and if there are multiple players within the same distance, players are prioritised in their party's order (which correlates with the orbs on the top-left of the screen; the topmost player is prioritised first). Players not targeted by the Maiden therefore do not need to protect from Magic, although it is recommended to have active in case the other players move farther from her.\n\nThe Maiden will also throw blood spots at each player dealing large amounts of damage and healing her every tick if not dodged. They have a chance to become a [[blood spawn]] which will track randomly around the room, leaving a blood trail behind it also. If a player stands on the trail, it will damage them and heal the Maiden for the same damage taken, as well as increase the chance of a blood spawn appearing.\n\nIf there are multiple blood spawns, it is suggested to freeze blood spawns and communicate with the teammates to swap gear, heal or restore magic up before progressing into the Nylocas phases.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMaiden of Sugadinti artwork.jpg|Artwork of the Maiden of Sugadinti\nThe Maiden of Sugadinti model.gif|A work in progress model of The Maiden of Sugadinti\nThe Maiden of Sugadinti model 2.gif|A work in progress model of The Maiden of Sugadinti\n</gallery>\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Change|date=9 January 2020|update=Eating in the Bank|poll=Old School Content Poll 69: Game Improvements|change=<nowiki />\n*The chance of successfully freezing Nylocas Matomenos now scale based on the player's effective magic attack bonus (including hidden bonuses such as the Void knight set), reaching 100% at +140 and above.\n*The chance of blood spawns appearing is now halved if all players dodge the blood splat attack, and their maximum amount is capped at eight.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Sugadinti\" means \"ruin\" <sup>''(verb)''</sup> or \"ruined\" <sup>''(adjective)''</sup> in Lithuanian.\n*The Maiden of Sugadinti is the tallest boss model when she performs her attack animation.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ghost|url=https://twitter.com/Jagex_Ghost/status/971092264855498752|date=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/LCJkF|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Today I've been working on The Maiden's animations and realised at one point she becomes our tallest OS boss model yet!

Mimics can be obtained from an [[Reward casket (elite)|elite]] or [[Reward casket (master)|master reward casket]] '''after''' asking the strange casket to enable the chance to obtain a mimic casket (which is disabled by default). The elite reward casket has a 1/35 chance of being a mimic, while master reward caskets have a 1/15 chance.\n[[File:The Mimic fight area.png|thumb|left|250px|The area in which the player fights The Mimic.]]\n\nPlayers have six chances to kill The Mimic from a master clue, five from an elite clue, which corresponds to the item rolls from the obtained casket. Every time a player leaves or dies, the amount of rolls on the drop table is decreased by one. If a player fails every attempt, they will not receive any loot from the original clue scroll.  \n\n==Fight overview==\n{{main|The Mimic/Strategies}}\nWith the right strategy, The Mimic is very easy to defeat for any high-level player. \n\nAlways use [[Protect from Melee]], move around the room when the Mimic throws sweets, and ignore the spawned Third Age minions. Use stat-boosting potions and prayers as well.\n\n* The quickest way to slay The Mimic is to bring [[dragon claws]] or a [[dragon dagger]] with full [[strength bonus|melee gear]], then after using the two/four special attacks, switch into a full magic setup with a [[powered staff]].\n* Alternatively, using magic, The Mimic can be frozen using [[ice spells]] or [[Entangle]] evading the melee attack completely. [[Powered staves]] can then be used to quickly kill The Mimic.\n* Although The Mimic is weak to [[Magic]], players can also opt to use [[Ranged]] with a [[toxic blowpipe]]. \n\n[[File:Fighting The Mimic.png|thumb|left|260px|A player faces The Mimic.]]\nThe Mimic has three different attacks:\n\n* '''Melee attack:''' The Mimic can hit you with a normal melee attack if you are standing beside it.\n\n* '''Candy Attack:''' The Mimic throws six candies at you. If you fail to step out of the way, you will receive about 10 damage. Three candies are purple, and there is one red, one blue and one green candy. The red, blue and green candies spawn the [[Third Age Warrior]], [[Third Age Mage]] and [[Third Age Ranger]] respectively. There is no benefit to killing them as they drop nothing and, when killed, they instantly respawn when another candy attack occurs.\n\n* '''Stomp Attack:''' Sometimes, The Mimic will step one tile forward onto you. Alternatively, this attack is activated when you walk under The Mimic. For every tick (0.6 seconds) that you stand under The Mimic, you will receive damage. The damage scales as follows: 1-1-1-2-2-2-3-... and so on, capping out at 6 damage. Simply step away from The Mimic to stop and reset the damage counter.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mahogany plank|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n:''Bonus loot is occasionally received in addition to the regular 1-6 clue scroll rolls when opening the [[Mimic]] casket.''\n\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=480; 600|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=400; 500|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy ranarr weed|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw manta ray|Quantity=15 (noted)|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wine of zamorak|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ring of 3rd age|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/40|Raritynotes=<ref group='d'>Chance from a master and elite chest respectively, and receiving one will replace one of the normal clue scroll rolls.

There are no requirements to fight The Nightmare other than access to [[Morytania]].\n\nThe Nightmare currently resides within the [[Sisterhood Sanctuary]] under the town of [[Slepe]]. While her physical body is found in the Sisterhood Sanctuary, upon starting the fight, players will be transported to her dream world, where the fight arena takes on a different appearance which contains various Eastern motifs, such as {{WP|Torii}} gates.\n\n==History==\nThe Nightmare's true origins are unknown, but according to a legend in {{RSL|Ashihama}}, it was told that an ancient ritual was performed by several shamans, birthing an otherworldly horror that took on the appearance of a large, hag-like woman. For as long as the sirens of Ashihama can remember, The Nightmare has plagued them, their dreams stolen and feasted upon. These shamans appeared to have attempted to fight off The Nightmare, eventually culminating in the creation of four totems that could channel power to stop her, but the shamans were wiped out before they could use them on her.\n\nOne day, a group of sirens, led by [[Shura]], defeated The Nightmare in its lair. Driven out of Ashihama, it fled west to the mainland, where it arrived in the [[Morytania]]n town of [[Slepe]]. Shura, wary of the danger The Nightmare poses, decided to pursue her to protect her home from the eldritch horror.\n\nThe Nightmare arrived at an opportune moment, with the town suffering from the sleeper plague. This in turn has allowed The Nightmare to draw victims into her dream world, stealing their dreams and feasting upon them, becoming stronger in the process. Shura, in turn, has enlisted the aid of numerous adventurers to keep The Nightmare in check, until she can defeat the Nightmare once and for all.\n\nFor a single week, The Nightmare attempted to harvest [[Phosani]]'s dreams, but adventurers tasked by [[Sister Senga]] were able to drive her off, although the power she gained from the former Justiciar remains unknown.\n\n==Getting there==\nThe quickest methods of reaching Slepe, where The Nightmare resides, are:\n*Teleporting to [[Ver Sinhaza]] via [[Drakan's medallion]], then running north. Once players pass the small dock, they can run east to arrive at Slepe.\n*Teleporting to [[Darkmeyer]] via Drakan's medallion after completion of [[Sins of the Father]], then running to the shortcut on the east side of the city (requires 63 [[Agility]] and two [[Long rope|long ropes]] to unlock). Players can then run east to Slepe.\n*Using the [[Ectophial]] to teleport to the [[Ectofuntus]], then heading north to the small dock and paying [[Andras]] 10,000 coins to row to Slepe. The player will arrive at a dock just south-west of Slepe. Players may also pay Andras a one-off fee of 1,000,000 coins to gain permanent access to his boat for free.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|The Nightmare/Strategies}}\nTo begin the fight, approach The Nightmare's unconscious body and select the Disturb option. Players may join in the following 30 seconds before the fight begins: afterwards, players must wait until the fight is over (with The Nightmare or all the players defeated) before they may join.\n\nUnlike other boss fights, The Nightmare's health and combat stats scale to the number of players in the fight (ranging from 5\u201380 players), though players can fight her with fewer than five. If The Nightmare is floating in the centre rather than lying on the ground, it is an indication that she is fighting a group of players; the symbols on the ground also indicate the phase she is in.\n\nThe Nightmare's melee attack ignores accuracy and always hits. In addition, players take 20% of her base damage if using [[Protect from Melee]], and 120% of her base damage if using the incorrect protection prayer. If the Nightmare has very low combat stats, her max hit will be at least a random number between 1-5, subject to the effects of prayer.\n\n==Drops==\n[[File:Fighting The Nightmare.png|thumb|250px|A large group of players in a mental battle against The Nightmare of Ashihama.]]\nEvery player in the fight who reaches the minimum damage threshold (which requires dealing damage to both The Nightmare's mental shield and the totems) will be eligible to receive a drop, with the quantity increasing based on how much damage they have done.\n\nThe player who deals the most damage in the fight will receive big bones and 10% additional non-unique loot. Additionally, when unique drops are rolled, a weighting system based on damage dealt determines which player will receive it.

They are relatively annoying monsters that throw rocks at passing adventurers, regardless of being engaged in [[combat]] or not. They are rarely ever on their own, preferring to be together in groups. Unlike most other monsters, the thrower troll's attacks are always [[successful hit]]s. As they are found in [[multi-way]] areas, being attacked by three or more thrower trolls at once can be deadly.\n\nEquipping a [[Neitiznot shield]] will reduce their maximum hit to 2.\n\nThe Thrower Trolls on Death Plateau's north side can be lured and safespotted using melee. For example, if a player targets the easternmost thrower, hits it once and then runs south-east, the thrower will throw once and then follow.

He attacks using hammers, so armour defensive against crush is advised. Despite his inaccuracy, he can still hit up to 24 so the use of [[Protect from Melee]] is advised for players with low [[Defence]].

They can even launch this attack over walls, though if they are in the spaces right in front of one of the three gates, they cannot shoot over it, so keeping them closed will block those directly in front of it.\n\nEven though their attacks are magical, they actually roll against [[ranged]] defence.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/664867829766881280|date=12 November 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uLTSQ|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Torchers roll magic accuracy vs range defence.}}\n\n==Level table==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Level\n!Hit points\n!Max hit\n!Colour\n!Novice\n!Intermediate\n!Veteran\n|-\n|33||18||6||Tan||{{Yes}}||{{No}}||{{No}}\n|-\n|49||30||8||Blue||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}||{{No}}\n|-\n|66||45||9||Orange||{{No}}||{{Yes}}||{{No}}\n|-\n|79||57||11||Green||{{No}}||{{Yes}}||{{Yes}}\n|-\n|91,92||71||12||Grey||{{No}}||{{No}}||{{Yes}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Pest Control}}",

They can be found northwest of the [[Grand Tree]] in the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]], just north of the swamp. [[Trainer Nacklepen]] is in charge of their combat development.\n\n==Fighting==\nWhen fighting the tortoise with riders, the three gnomes take turns attacking the player. The mage sends a bluish spell towards the player. The ranger shoots a steel arrow at the player, and the tortoise attacks with the driver holding the reins if the player is within their meleeing range. Protection [[prayer]]s aren't very effective because the riders use all 3 combat styles; however, the tortoises hit hardest with melee, so that prayer will stop the most damage.\n\nWhen the mounted tortoise is slain, the riders, which consist of a level 5 [[Gnome Archer]], [[Gnome Driver]], and a [[Gnome Mage]] spawn. This can prove somewhat dangerous for low levelled (under 80 combat) players, as these gnomes are fairly accurate for their level. If the player runs away, however, they become unaggressive, and eventually disappear when the tortoise respawns.\n\nIf the player is not in multi combat only the [[Gnome Driver]] will attack the player. While in multi combat sometimes the gnomes don't attack the player or only attack one at a time. The Gnomes will cry out for \"Dobbie\", apparently referring to the slain tortoise. They will despawn after around 48 seconds if they are not killed before. The player will not receive combat or hitpoints experience for slaying these gnomes.\n\n==Location==\n*[[Battlefield]] of Khazard, south-west of [[Ardougne]] - 2\n*Pen north of [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] toad swamp - 3\n\n==Drops without riders==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=1-3|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steel arrow|Quantity=12-23|Rarity=20/128|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>There is a 10/128 chance of steel arrows dropping alone, and a 10/128 chance of steel arrows dropping with the seed drop table.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=10-14|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|10/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|10/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n<!-- Assume fixed allotment for now, however we need to test more for other seeds -->\n{{GeneralSeedDropTable|10/128|override=There is a 10/128 chance of rolling the [[general seed drop table]], with the exception of one set of cabbage seeds that are also an individual drop.

Also it is not advised to use the [[bronze axe]] dropped from the [[zombies]] to kill it as the axe is weak and the tree spirit has a really high defence. It's easy to range the Dramen Tree spirit because it seems to have low defence against ranged. [[Arrows]], unstrung [[bows]] and [[Bowstring|bow strings]] are allowed on the island. Simply string the bow when you reach the dungeon.

He has the power to possess objects around him and send them hurtling towards players. He is summoned when the player attempts to pick up the [[Innocent-looking Key]].\n\nHe uses these three main attacks:\n*''Crane'' - When you step in a square around a possessed crane, it will take a snap out of the player. It rarely hits above 10, but can hit in the '''low 30s.''' This is the second most dangerous attack out of three.\n*''Mine Cart'' - When a player steps on a cart track, a mine cart will be sent tumbling after them. This can hit up to 9 damage every half second, which can equal to '''36 damage every 2 seconds''' if you're unfortunate. This is the most dangerous attack. This attack can quite easily be avoided by running across the tracks instead as the cart will only move when the player is in its target range. However, the boss fight is very long, so bringing [[super energy potion]]s is recommended.\n*''Pickaxes'' - If the player is not near any other obstacle, Treus Dayth will simply make pickaxes appear and be shot at them. These hit up to 15 damage each, and the [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer only provides '''partial''' protection from this attack. Pickaxes are the least dangerous attack.\n\nHe can be fought in the [[Nightmare Zone]] after the quest is complete, although in there, he will not have any obstacles to command and is therefore very easy to kill, especially with [[Ranged]].\n\n==Treus Dayth's imprisonment==\n[[Lord Drakan]] had the [[Abandoned Mine]] destroyed after the holy [[River Salve]] started to seep into the lower shaft of the mine. Although most of the water was tainted by the land's twisted soil, some remained pure and retained [[Saradomin]]'s blessing. Purple crystals were growing in the mine and absorbed the blessing. When exposed to the unholy creatures of the land, the crystals would severely weaken or even kill them. To prevent the crystals from falling into the hands of Saradominists, Drakan then imprisoned Treus Dayth, who was one of his followers, to guard the crystals on the lowest level. Even after Treus Dayth died, his tortured soul continued to serve as the mine's guardian.\n\nThe crystals are known to players as the [[Salve amulet]] or [[Salve amulet (e)]].\n\n==Strategy==\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Crystal-mine key.png|thumb|The crystal mine key appears suspiciously easy to take.]]\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Fighting Treus Dayth.png|thumb|A player fighting Treus Dayth.]]\nTreus Dayth has a nasty habit of teleporting in spots where the machinery can hit you. All that needs to be done is look where he is standing, and carefully walk around equipment to get to him. He can be difficult to fight for multiple reasons:\n\n# He controls the objects around the room, namely the mine carts and cranes, causing them to damage you. The cranes will attack you immediately if you come close enough, but [[Protect from Melee]] helps to mitigate some of the damage they do. Treus may activate the mine carts when you step on the mine cart tracks, and he will activate the mine carts much more frequently the closer he comes to dying.\n# He will move around the room, only staying in one place for a very short amount of time, though he only moves once you begin to attack him. He tends to shift around with increased frequency the closer he comes to dying, sometimes even only allowing you one attack, regardless of whether it lands.\n# He will regularly hit upwards of 10 with the pickaxes. An inventory of good food (preferably [[monkfish]] or better) is recommended.\n\nThe player will take substantial damage constantly; if it's not the mine carts or the cranes, it's the pickaxes that will hit you anywhere you are in the room. [[Protect from Missiles]] helps since his attack style is [[Ranged]]-based, although this merely reduces damage, and his attacks are still quite damaging. Using [[super energy potion]]s is also a good idea as the boss fight is extremely long because of how he moves around. Having to walk around whilst being hit by the mine carts and cranes is quite deadly, especially if the player is low-levelled. Note that the [[Crumble Undead]] spell is quite effective and viable. Because of all the obstacles in the room, using\u00a0[[Magic]] or Ranged will often require that you stand next to him to be able to attack, so it is best you use your strongest attack style as each is essentially limited to [[Melee]] range.\n\nFor lower levels who have access to [[Crumble Undead]], using this with [[Rune armour]] may be the easiest method. Since Treus Dayth has negative magic defence, players can still hit even when wearing armour like Rune. Having more defensive armour than something like [[Mystic robes|Mystic]] can drastically reduce damage taken from the surroundings.\n\n==Drops==\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (beginner)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/90|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Treus Dayth counts as a ghost for a slayer task to kill ghosts, so the damage boosts from a [[black mask]] or [[slayer helmet]] are applied.\n\n{{Haunted Mine}}\n{{Nightmare Zone}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

However, high-tier melee armour (such as [[Barrows armour|Barrows]]) is still recommended if not using prayer, as they can hit '''extremely''' hard (up to 38). Their attack speed of 4 (same speed as an [[Abyssal whip]] or a scimitar) can also prove deadly if they hit twice or thrice in a row. Therefore, use of the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer is strongly recommended if you're not using high-tier melee armour.\n\nIt is possible to use halberds, [[ranged]] or [[magic]] attacks on the generals safely, as their large size allows them to be corner [[safespot]]ted. Extreme caution is advised at all times, as they can leave their respective rooms, although this is a rare occurrence, and they only attack if the player walks right next to them. It is possible to poison them, run out of their range, and let the poison do most of the work.\n\nThe troll general in the far north-west room can be safespotted by standing in the corridor between his bed and the wall.

They drop [[herbs]] and [[seeds]] commonly, though not as frequently as [[aberrant spectre]]s, as well as frequent [[nature rune]]s. In addition, they also drop the [[leaf-bladed sword]].\n\nTuroths, like [[Kurask]]s, can only be damaged with [[leaf-bladed weapons]]. Turoths are immune to other types of attacks, thereby establishing hidden skill requirements to kill them (particularly for [[ironmen]]). Though most of the means available for attacking them cannot inflict poison, it is still possible to inflict [[venom]] by using either a [[serpentine helm]] or a [[Toxic staff of the dead]] with [[Magic dart]].\n\nThe majority of the Turoths are level 83 and 85; there is only one (1) level 89 and three (3) level 87s in the dungeon.\n\nTuroths are not aggressive; these monsters cannot be slain via AFK for slayer tasks.\n\nHigher level players can complete the entire slayer tasks without food or super combat potions if they wear the [[Hitpoints cape|Hitpoints Skillcape]] and the [[Regen Bracelet]] along with higher tier melee armour.\n\n==Location==\n* [[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]]: [[Slayer ring]]s\u00a0offer immediate access to this dungeon.

Players who are unable to use any of these options can use a [[Camelot teleport]] and make a long run north/north-west towards Rellekka and then east after passing the second bridge. Alternatively, players may teleport to Lunar Isle without a seal of passage and talk to an NPC to be kicked off the island to Rellekka; they may also teleport to Waterbirth Island and take the boat to Rellekka.

A Tyras Guard is fought during the [[Regicide]] quest.\n==Strategy==\nA Tyras Guard can hit up to 15, and though there are a few [[safespots]], his [[halberd]] can reach over most of them, so food is strongly advised. Protect from melee will prevent a Tyras guard from damaging the player, however those lacking prayer levels and/or points will need another strategy. [[Magic]] or [[Ancient Magicks]] can be dangerous to use because most robes have low defence and there is a lack of safespots, but it has proven to be effective. If using Ancient Magicks, a player can attack with [[ice spells]] so the Guard cannot move, which is highly effective because of his weakness to Magic, and binding the guard results in most if not all damage being avoided during the fight.

It is currently the second [[strongest monster]] in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'', and the strongest monster that must be challenged alone.\n\nAccording to [[TzHaar-Ket-Keh]], TzKal-Zuk is the apparent leader of the feral [[TzHaar]] in the Inferno.\n\nPlayers can pay 100 [[slayer reward point]]s to have [[Duradel]] or [[Nieve]] assign [[TzHaar]] as a [[slayer]] assignment. When players have TzHaar as a slayer task, they will be prompted with an option to be assigned 1 [[TzTok-Jad]] or 1 TzKal-Zuk; the latter requires having killed TzKal-Zuk '''at least once''' before being able to have him assigned. Players who succeed in defeating him on task will receive 101,890 slayer experience.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs TzKal-Zuk is isolated from the platform the player is on, he cannot be attacked with melee. Only ranged or magic attacks will be able to reach him.\n\nThe [[twisted bow]] is the most effective weapon to use against TzKal-Zuk, followed by the [[Armadyl crossbow]]. The [[toxic blowpipe]] is also recommended for killing the minions that appear during the fight.\n\nDuring the fight, a shield will appear to protect the player from TzKal-Zuk's attacks. The shield has 600 hitpoints and will move, so players will need to move alongside it to avoid taking damage from TzKal-Zuk. If the player does not get behind the shield when TzKal-Zuk attacks, they run the possibility of taking massive damage from its attacks. It is possible for TzKal-Zuk's attacks to miss or deal survivable damage, though this should not be relied on. [[Tick manipulation|Tick eating]] does not work against TzKal-Zuk. The toxic blowpipe's short range may lure the player out of the shield's protection when attacking a monster, so caution should be exercised when wielding it.\n\nIn addition to this, a [[Jal-Xil]] and [[Jal-Zek]] will appear periodically throughout the fight and attack the shield. It is imperative to keep them off the shield, as if the shield is destroyed, the player's chances of survival are essentially zero. Pray accordingly against the two and focus on TzKal-Zuk once both minions are killed.\n\nWhen TzKal-Zuk reaches 480 hitpoints, a [[JalTok-Jad]] will appear and attack the shield. Tag and kill it immediately as leaving it alive can be problematic, especially when more Jal-Xil and Jal-Zeks reappear.\n\nAt 240 hitpoints, TzKal-Zuk will attack faster and 4 [[Jal-MejJak]]s will appear from the lava and start healing TzKal-Zuk. The Jal-MejJaks will heal about 25 hitpoints on average, and will quickly heal TzKal-Zuk if not attacked. Once attacked, the Jal-MejJak will attack the area in front of it, dealing 7-10 damage with their AoE attacks. Kill the Jal-MejJaks before focusing on TzKal-Zuk again. It is best to wait for the Jal-Xil and Jal-Zek to respawn again before triggering the appearance of the Jal-MejJaks to kill the healers without much inconvenience.

With a\u00a0[[combat level]] of 702, TzTok-Jad has a max hit of 97 and can easily kill most players in one hit with any of its three attacks: a [[Melee]] attack with its bite, a blast of [[Magic]] in the form of a fireball, and a boulder falling from the ceiling as a [[Ranged]] attack. To add to the challenge, players must fight through waves of monsters in the TzHaar Fight Cave in order to reach TzTok-Jad and must do so solo and without being able to restock on supplies from the previous waves.\n\n== Slayer ==\nPlayers can pay 100 [[slayer reward point]]s to have [[Duradel]], [[Nieve]], or [[Chaeldar]] assign [[TzHaar]] as a possible [[Slayer task]]. When players receive TzHaar as a slayer assignment, they will be prompted with an option to be assigned 1 TzTok-Jad instead. \n\nThis gives players the option to use their [[Black mask (i)|imbued black mask]]/[[Slayer helm (i)|slayer helm]]'s damage and accuracy bonuses on all monsters encountered in the fight caves. Players who accept this challenge will receive [[Slayer]] [[experience]] for each of the monsters in the Fight Cave that they defeat, as well as 25,250 Slayer experience should they defeat TzTok-Jad himself, totalling 37,010 xp for the entire cave.\n\nIf the player is to leave the fight cave during your task, either manually or by dying, they will receive the following message: ''You no longer have a slayer task as you left the fight cave.'' This will '''not''' reset a players task streak, and can be used as a way to quickly skip this task without the use of slayer points.\n\n==Fighting TzTok-Jad==\n{{Main|TzHaar Fight Cave/Strategies#TzTok-Jad}}\n[[File:Fighting TzTok-Jad.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fighting TzTok-Jad.]]\nTzTok-Jad is the boss monster of the TzHaar Fight Cave, and is encountered on Wave 63 (the final wave). This is the only place where Jad can be found.\n\nOnce TzTok-Jad is reached, fighting and defeating him requires decent skill and reflexes. It is possible to engage TzTok-Jad using [[Melee]], but it is more difficult to switch between the [[Protect from Melee]], [[Protect from Missiles]], and [[Protect from Magic]] prayers. TzTok-Jad only uses Ranged and Magic attacks at a distance, however. As he is resistant to Magic, using Ranged to attack him is recommended.\n\nTzTok-Jad has a very long [[attack range]], much like the [[Tok-Xil]] encountered earlier on in the Fight Cave. A very useful tip is to try to find out where the orange Ket-Zek spawned in the previous wave. As with all other waves where two enemies of the same type are encountered, the new monster will appear where the off-coloured monster spawned. This will allow you to prepare accordingly to prevent Jad from launching a surprise attack.\n\nTzTok-Jad will use attacks at random. It is critical that players know the warning signs for these attacks and switch between the protection prayers accordingly before the attack launches:\n[[File:TzTok-Jad Animations.gif|frame|TzTok-Jad's Ranged and Magic attacks.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = TzTok-Jad's magic attack sound\n|filename = TzTok-Jad Magic attack.ogg\n}}\n{{Listen\n|title = TzTok-Jad's ranged attack sound\n|filename = TzTok-Jad Ranged attack.ogg \n}}\n\n*'''Melee:''' TzTok-Jad thrusts\u00a0forward with a sharp bite. He only does this if the player is within melee distance. Unlike the Magic and Ranged attacks, the Melee attack is instant.\n*'''Magic:''' TzTok-Jad rears up on his hind legs and dangles his forward legs for a few seconds before launching a fireball from his mouth at the player.\n*'''Ranged:''' TzTok-Jad rears up on his hind legs, then slams down his front legs onto the ground causing a boulder to fall on the player (in which it is not possible to evade this boulder by running).\n\nAll of TzTok-Jad's attacks can deal up to '''97''' damage. While this means [[Vengeance]] can deal a lot of damage, one extremely high-damaging hit can mean the fight is over, especially if the [[Yt-HurKot]]s are attacking you.\n\nMonsters move east or west before moving north or south to reach you. This is very useful when trying to trap TzTok-Jad when it spawns.\n\nOnce TzTok-Jad is reduced to half health, he will summon\u00a0four [[Yt-HurKot]]s to come and heal him repeatedly \u2014 the player must deal with them whilst warding off TzTok-Jad's attacks. <u>If they manage to heal him to full health</u>, then they <u>should not be killed</u> as they will respawn once he is reduced to half health again. If they are distracted before healing him to full health, they '''will not respawn''' when killed.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you take the attention of the Yt-HurKots and they are hitting you, they\u00a0'''WILL''' still heal Jad if they are close enough to him.\n\n==Drops==\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Tzrek-jad|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/200|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Drop rate is 1/200 for completing the cave off-task and for sacrificing the [[Fire cape]].</ref><ref group=d>Drop rate is 1/100 if TzTok-Jad is killed while on a TzHaar slayer task.</ref>{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/632248480497541124|date=14 August 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/wfLLw|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Confirmed.

Ulfric and his men died soon afterwards.\n\nLater, [[Sven the Helmsman]] created a treasure map to the entrance of the cave.

They can be found in various sections of the [[Forthos Dungeon]]: the Crypt of the Moon east of the western dungeon entrance, the Temple Library (which has a nearby altar where players can recharge [[prayer]]) and the small chamber south of the Spider Den near [[Brother Aimeri]], which requires a [[knife]] or slash weapon to access.\n\nWhile not in [[melee]] range, they will only attack with their [[magic]] attack. Players can avoid damage entirely by [[Protect from Magic|praying against magic]] attacks.\n\nAn effective setup for fighting Undead Druids is to use [[Void ranger armour]] with a [[salve amulet(ei)]] while praying against magic.\n\n==Strategy==\nAs undead druids are undead, a [[Salve amulet(ei)]] (or simply the [[Salve amulet (e)|regular enchanted version]] if using [[melee]]) is '''highly''' recommended for fighting them.\n\nDue to their high [[Magic]] level and related bonuses, it is recommended to keep [[Protect from Magic]] on at all times while fighting them.\n\nBoth Melee and [[Ranged]] are highly effective against them, but Ranged may be preferable because they will only attack with magic while not in melee range, while players using melee will occasionally be hit. Rangers should use [[Void armour]] (preferably the [[Elite Void Knight equipment|elite]] version), while meleers will want to use the best strength setups that they have.\n\nThe highest-DPS setup to use is a [[Toxic blowpipe]] with the elite Void Knight set and a salve amulet (ei). Due to the low [[defence]] of the druids, equipment like [[devout boots]] can be used in slots where [[Ranged strength]] is not offered.\n\nWhile the Temple Library is adjacent to an [[altar]], only two moderately high level players can kill the druids faster than they spawn in the southern room, and will often have to stand around waiting for spawns. In contrast, the Crypt of the Moon requires the usage of [[prayer potion]]s, but has many more spawns.\n\nDue to the self-sustainable design of the dungeon, players can stay here for a long time without needing to bank by using the altar adjacent to the druids to restore prayer, and food from the Grubby Chest to restore health as needed. Most of the drops are either stackable, can be alched or stored in a herb bag. For this reason, bringing fire runes is recommended, since these are not dropped by the Undead Druids themselves.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=28654}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mask of ranul|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/1000|Raritynotes={{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Husky|url=https://twitter.com/JagexHusky/status/1156844944369377286|date=1 August 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/h8aa9|archivedate=1 August 2019|quote=For those interested, here are the drop-rates for the unique items within the Forthos Dungeon.[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA3wV4DW4AAVtos?format=jpg&name=small]|name=Forthos Dungeon Droprates}}}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=200-300|Rarity=5/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Earth rune|Quantity=200-300|Rarity=5/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=20-30|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=50-80|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=20-30|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=20-30|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nature rune|Quantity=20-30|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mud rune|Quantity=30-70|Rarity=3/100}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Law rune|Quantity=10-20|Rarity=2/100}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|22/100|override=There is a 22/100 chance of rolling the [[herb drop table]].

The [[Homunculus]] in the dungeon then creates the monster, which appears near the altar and will attack the player. Taking too long to kill will result in the disappearance of the unicow.\n\n==How to Train using Unicows==\nPlayers can train very efficiently on unicows. Approximately 40 [[Attack]], [[Strength]], and [[Defence]] are needed to do this.\n\nGo to the altar for the unicow, and activate the altar while having a [[cowhide]] and [[unicorn horn]] in the inventory. Kill the unicow for decent experience; they have low Attack and Strength. Pick up a unicorn horn to use next inventory. Around 14 cowhides are needed to obtain a full inventory of unicorn horns. Horns will always drop in noted form if you have completed all Medium Tasks in Ardougne Diary. You do not have to bring your cloak to get noted horns, but you will need to bring unnoted horns to summon unicows.

They can only be harmed by silver weapons or [[efaritay's aid]], and can be defeated by using the special attack of the [[Rod of ivandis]] or [[Ivandis flail]] and a dose of [[Guthix balance]] potion when it is below half health. This can result in the juvinate dying, reverting to human, or turning into an even more powerful [[feral vampyre]] (which are vulnerable to weapons other than silver). If the juvinate reverts into a human, they will thank you and give you a reward.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't have an Ivandis flail, you can lower the health of a juvinate enough for it to flee. This way, you will not have to use a charge on your Rod of Ivandis. When a juvinate reaches about 1/3 health, they will disappear and turn into a cloud of mist and say \"Ha, ha, ha, time to disappear and re-juvinate!\"\n\nA good strategy in Temple Trekking is to attack them with a ranged or magic attack immediately when they appear so they don't have a chance of attacking your follower. If there are too many for you to attack, try moving to manoeuvre them into an obstacle to ensure that it will not attack your follower. You must attack them before they attack your follower, otherwise the only way to stop it is by killing it. This can take some time due to how weak silver weapons are. Your follower may run out of food if you take too long to kill it.\n\nAnother good strategy to use is to fight them with [[Silver bolts]]. Depending on your [[ranged]] level, this may actually be a much faster way to kill juvinates than using a Rod of Ivandis. It is also very easy to [[safespot]] them with the large amount of plants and water in the area.\n\n==Returning a Juvinate to Human==\nWhen successfully returning a Juvinate to human, [[Benjamin]], [[Liam]], [[Miala]] or [[Verak]] will hand the player a noted reward.

When a player gets near one of the holes, all three will burst from the ground.\n\nAll Vanguards attack three times with each attack; however, the [[magic]] and [[ranged]] Vanguards use AoE attacks (one always hitting the player while two are launched elsewhere). The [[melee]] Vanguard simply attacks the player three times for every attack it performs. Protection prayers will not nullify their damage, but they will reduce it.\n[[File:Vanguard health difference near threshold.png|thumb|left|200px|The swirling mass around a Vanguard, indicating that the difference between the three's health is approaching the maximum threshold.]]\nTo harm the Vanguards, damage must be '''spread equally''' to all three Vanguards. If just one of the Vanguard is heavily damaged while the others have much higher health (a difference of 40% in groups or four or less, and 33.3% in groups of five or more), all the Vanguards will heal themselves back to full health upon shuffling; players will be able to tell when they've dealt too much damage via a swirling mass around them.\n\nTo stop this from occurring, the Vanguards' health must be within similar range of the other Vanguards by the time they shuffle positions. Stomp damage is applied to players under them when they shuffle; this damage '''will not''' occur when they attack players. When the Vanguards shuffle, they will lose aggression over any players; standing in the corners will typically only cause one of them to attack.\n\nAs uncontrolled high damage is detrimental, weapons with low damage per hit such as [[toxic blowpipe]] are highly recommended. It may also be worthwhile to not activate damage boosting prayers and unequip gear that increases damage if there is a risk of dealing too much damage. Knowing the maximum hit for each weapon used is helpful.\n\nIt should be noted that the ranged Vanguard is static, and will be unable to attack players that are under it. The melee and magic Vanguards will attempt to move out if the player is under them. The melee Vanguard often does not attack players next to the walls or edges as it cannot go too far from its spawn point, and it will back away if it is attacked from these spots until the attacker is in its range. In addition to this, Vanguards take no damage if they start shuffling, even if a damaging attack was headed their way. They will also slowly regenerate health passively. It is not recommended to use the [[dragon warhammer]] special on the Vanguards as their Defence resets after they return to their shell. [[Dragon claws]] or toxic blowpipe special attacks may be more useful, provided that they are used with caution as to not damage them over the threshold.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Vanguard judgement|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Elder (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"A\" name=\"vanguard\">The Vanguard's combat style determines which potion is dropped.</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Twisted (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"A\" name=\"vanguard\"/>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Kodai (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"A\" name=\"vanguard\"/>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Xeric's aid (+)(4)|Quantity=1-3|Rarity=Varies|Raritynotes=<ref group=\"A\" name=\"pots1\">A random mixture of potions is given.

Vanstrom is a murderous fiend who strikes terror into the hearts of the [[Myreque]], a resilient group of people from Morytania dedicated to fighting their vampyre overlords. Vanstrom is [[Safalaan|Safalaan Hallow]]'s father, the former King [[Ascertes]] Hallow, who was transformed into a vampyre by [[Lowerniel Drakan]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early History===\nAfter being transformed into a vampyre by Lowerniel, the first thing that Vanstrom did was kill his daughter. Vanstrom swore loyalty to Lowerniel, and was given the position of tithe master in all of Morytania, overseeing the blood tithes throughout the region. He was also tasked with destroying any rebel cells that sprung up to oppose Lowerniel's rule.\n\n===The Myreque===\nVanstrom soon learned of a rebel organization, the Myreque. Though he knew the identities of members of the organization, he did not kill them off one by one, as it would have caused suspicion. Much to his dismay, however, he was unable to find their hideout, where he could put an end to the rebels once and for all. Vanstrom soon discovered a human who had crossed the Salve and into Morytania. In his human form, he convinced the adventurer to help bring him some steel weaponry for the Myreque, claiming that he didn't have the time to do so. Tracking the adventurer, he soon discovered the hideout and barged in, killing [[Sani Piliu]] and [[Harold Evans]]. He then dispatched a [[skeletal hellhound]] to kill the remaining members. To his disappointment, the rebels were able to escape after the adventurer killed the hellhound.\n\n===Finding Burgh de Rott===\nSome time later, Vanstrom was speaking to [[Gadderanks]], a human blood collector. He expressed disappointment with Gadderank's inability to fulfill his quota. Gadderanks defended himself by stating that there wasn't enough to tithe, as [[Malak]] got sick after consuming blood from [[Mort'ton]], and while [[Canifis]] was giving more blood than agreed, it was not enough. Vanstrom then smelled some smoke which came from the town of [[Burgh de Rott]]; the adventurer had repaired the furnace, which alerted him to their position. Vanstrom then sent Gadderanks and two juvinates to begin blood tithes there, but they were killed by the same adventurer. It is also implied that Vanstrom sent some juvinates to intercept [[Ivan Strom]]'s journey to Paterdomus temple, but this failed.\n\n===Second Encounter===\nAs the adventurer is taking sketches of Castle Drakan, Vanstrom spots and attacks them. He overpowers the adventurer, but is forced to let them go after [[Sarius Guile]], [[Vanescula Drakan|Vanescula]]'s servant, informs him that Vanescula wanted them alive. Vanstrom grudgingly complies and leaves the scene.\n\n===Search for the Myreque===\nKnowing the Myreque was a continued threat to the vampyres, Vanstrom worked with [[Ranis Drakan]]. The two paid a visit to [[Verzik Vitur]] at her [[Ver Sinhaza|castle]]. Verzik gave the two her [[abomination]], claiming that once it obtained a whiff of a target's blood, it could track them anywhere. Vanstrom then headed to [[Serafina]]'s former home and created an elegant trap that was able to trick Safalaan into giving up his blood, allowing the abomination to discover the location of the hideout. As with Ranis, he confidently believed that the Myreque were finally wiped out, but soon learned that Ranis was killed by the adventurer.\n\n===More Problems and Death===\nFollowing Ranis' death, Vanstrom was still unable to locate the Myreque. However, he had more pressing matters at hand, having learned of an illegal blood tithing operation at [[Slepe]]. He confronted [[Damien Leucurte]] at the Crombwick mansion basement, where he met [[Kroy]]. Vanstrom immediately disliked Kroy, considering him to be \"barely\" a proper juvenile, but soon learned from the juvenile that he had replicated the Elixir of Everlasting. Damien stated that they then mixed the elixir into the town's [[Bloody bracer]]s, putting the humans into a deep sleep and allowed them to take more blood as they had less uses for it. \n\nVanstrom asked Damien who allowed him to do this. Damien stated that the nobles of Darkmeyer had requested it, but Vanstrom overruled him and stated that he would be the one to decide. Although impressed by the idea, he warned Damien that he had attracted the attention of the Myreque, including the human that had killed Ranis; due to his position, House Drakan could not protect him. Damien asked for protection, but Vanstrom refused, as he had defied Lowerniel for the last time and left.\n\nThe adventurer infiltrated [[Darkmeyer]] and attempted to enter the Arboretum, but was denied by [[Desmodus Lasiurus]]. Fortunately, they were able to bargain with Desmodus, who had the rightful custody of Gadderank's wife and son following his death as Vanstrom owed him a favour. However, the juvinate that was supposed to relieve them to him, [[Mordan Nikazsi]], had been intercepted by [[Lord Alexei Jovkai]], who had bought them off. The adventurer snuck into the prison the Gadderanks family was being held in, but was caught by Alexei, who asked what they were doing. Vanstrom, who had been on his way to the lower levels of the city, heard Alexei's shouting and investigated. Upon being informed of the situation, he recognized the Gadderanks family, and ordered Alexei to relinquish them, as they belonged to Desmodus. Vanstrom then recognized the adventurer's voice and demanded to see their face, which would have broken their cover, but Sarius soon arrived and stated that Vanescula needed him, much to his annoyance.\n\nAfter the adventurer acquired blisterwood sickles for the Myreque, Vanescula teleported the invasion party to Castle Drakan. She was immediately met by Vanstrom, who asked her what she was doing. He was surprised to learn that she had somehow obtained all of the Myreque when he had not, unaware of her plot to overthrow Lowerniel. However, Lowerniel anticipated her treason and confronted them instead, killing off Vanescula's vyres and half of the Myreque team. Lowerniel then tasked Vanstrom with killing off the remaining members as he apprehended Vanescula. Although Vanstrom had numerous powers at his disposal, the adventurer was able to defeat him. Safalaan then attempted to appeal to his past as Ascertes, but Vanstrom claimed that he had been uplifted and enjoyed killing his daughter. In response to this, Safalaan emitted a blast of energy that killed Vanstrom.\n\n{{Vampyres}}\n{{In Search of the Myreque}}\n{{In Aid of the Myreque}}\n{{Darkness of Hallowvale}}\n{{A Taste of Hope}}\n{{Sins of the Father}}",

Upon approaching the pile, he will animate himself and start the fight. He will also raise a purple flame at the entrance, which will damage players who pass through it. The fight begins with his special attack.\n\nVasa has a special attack that he can use when he is at the centre, where he will teleport everyone in the room. Half of the team will be teleported to the edges, while the remaining half will be teleported next to him (if soloing, you will always be teleported to him). Those next to him will be [[Stun (status)|stunned]] and have their prayers disabled. Those teleported to the edges should run to the centre and activate [[Protect from Magic]]. Vasa will unleash a magical barrage against everyone next to him, dealing massive damage.\n\nThe damage of the attack is calculated based on the accumulated HP of the stunned players at the time of the teleport. If only one player is stunned, then the damage is their current HP -5. This damage is then divided by the number of players who take the hit. For instance, if 2 players receive the hit, then the damage is divided by 2, if a third unstunned player runs in to receive the hit, then the damage is divided by 3. Unstunned players are able to use [[Protect from Magic]] in order to negate the damage they would receive - however, this doesn't affect the overall calculation of the damage the other players will receive.<!-- citation needed --> Vasa is immune to attacks while charging his special attack.\n\nFor teams, the player with the least amount of [[Hitpoints]] should initiate the battle in Melee gear and stand next to him; then, teammates should cross the flame and use [[Protect from Magic]] next to him. After his [[magical]] attack, players can switch to [[Protect from Missiles]]. If the team has [[Overload (Chambers of Xeric)|overloads]], using them before entering the room is a good idea. Solo players will have to take the special attack's full effect (at the start of the fight as well as any consequent times), but they can heal between the teleport and taking damage to not risk being at 5 Hitpoints.\n\nIt is recommended to use the Protect from Missiles prayer, as while walking to the [[glowing crystal]]s, Vasa will throw rocks at the team, which can deal significant damage. Fortunately, these rocks can be avoided by running away from the spot they are thrown at (the rocks have a 3x3 area of effect). Ranging is recommended against Vasa and, due to his high Magic level, he is weak to the [[twisted bow]].\n\nThroughout the fight, Vasa will move towards a cluster of crystals, which are located in the corners of the room. These crystals will heal Vasa, so it is important to target them as quick as possible to minimise the amount of healing he can perform. They are weak to [[stab]] attacks. After healing enough, Vasa will use his special attack upon returning to the middle of the room. Otherwise, he will walk to another set of crystals.\n\nPlayers under Vasa will take rapid stomp damage from him.\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Nistirio's manifesto|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Endarkened juice|Quantity=5|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Xeric's aid (+)(4)|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Twisted (+)(4)|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=10 January 2019|update=The Kebos Lowlands|change=The examine text was slighty modified, the old examine text was \"A former Arceuus Elder, fused with the rock and bound to the dark crystals.\"}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chambers of Xeric}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]",

This is because her habitat is surrounded by a single-way area, and all of the [[Wilderness bosses]] (excluding [[demi-bosses]]) reside in [[multi-way area]]s. Players can still deal full damage to her while standing in the single-way area if she remains in a multi-way area.\n*On release, the tree stump found south-east of the trees in 24 Wilderness was one square south than what it is now. This was changed in an update in order to prevent players [[safespot]]ting Venenatis behind the trees. However, it can still be done, albeit with a lot more effort.\n*If Venenatis is lured south near [[single-way combat]] and attacks a player with her multi-target Magic attack, any nearby players in the single-way combat zone already in combat with another entity will also be hit. This may be an oversight by Jagex.\n*Venenatis' model is a recolored version of [[Kalrag]].\n\n{{Spiders}}\n{{Wilderness}}\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Old School-exclusive content]]\n[[Category:Wilderness]]\n[[Category:Monsters that do not become tolerant]]",

She is the final boss of the [[Theatre of Blood]], and currently the strongest monster in Old School RuneScape.\n\n==History==\nVerzik Vitur was the head of the Vitur family on her homeworld of [[Vampyrium]], and arrived in [[Gielinor]] alongside many other [[vampyre]]s during the [[Second Age]] by [[Zaros]], who the vampyres refer to as the \"Stranger from Afar\". Before her departure, she had domesticated a large number of [[nylocas]], which she brought with her to Gielinor. Verzik was on good terms with the Drakan family, and was known by [[Vanescula Drakan]] to \"play\" with her food. \n\nDuring [[Lowerniel Drakan]]'s conquest of Hallowvale, Verzik worked with [[Ranis Drakan]], capturing a Saradominist [[Justiciar]] and tortured him for several days. The Justiciar revealed a secret tunnel underneath the royal castle, which allowed Lowerniel's forces to capture [[Ascertes]]. Although Vanescula believed that Lowerniel did not like having the war end so early, he nonetheless rewarded Verzik with Efaritay's castle. Verzik would later oversee a massive renovation of the castle, which then became known as [[Ver Sinhaza]].\n\nDue to \"playing\" with her food, she often demanded entertainment on the spot from her vampyre soldiers. She eventually became bored of this and had the Theatre of Blood constructed, where powerful creatures would be placed inside for challengers to fight under the pretense of freedom from blood tithes should they prevail. Although some challengers generally bested the creatures, much to Verzik's delight, she personally finished off those who made it to her, not intending to give freedom at all.\n\nShe also created an extensive breeding program for her nylocas, which resulted in three new types of Nylocas. One of these Nylocas bit her, which granted her new abilities but also made her obese and vulnerable to non-silver weaponry. She complained of a sickness, prompting the doctor [[Vulcan Orvoros]] to pay a visit. Although he helped her, he discovered the symptoms had returned and tried to persuade her to visit his office in Darkmeyer, but she refused. She likely had him killed shortly afterwards.\n\nVerzik makes a small appearance in [[A Taste of Hope]], where she gives [[Vanstrom Klause]] and [[Ranis Drakan]] an [[Abomination]] to help them hunt down [[The Myreque]].\n\nAfter opening the Theater of Blood to all, Verzik encountered a particular set of outside humans that bested the creatures and eventually made it to her. Although she was impressed with their skills and thoroughly entertained by their performance, she stated that she couldn't let them leave and intended to kill them. Despite her best efforts (including the use of her vampyre-nylocas form), the group proved to be too strong, and Verzik was forced to flee, transforming into a bat, much to her apparent embarrassment. Despite this, she eventually returned to see more challengers, even if they were the same ones who could best her in battle.\n\n==Dialogue==\n{{hastranscript|npc}}\n\n==Mechanics==\nTo initiate the fight, a player must first talk to Verzik Vitur.\nShe will have 3 phases:\n*During phase 1, players in the raid must take it in turn to use the [[Dawnbringer]]'s special attack in order to harm Verzik. Any other weapon will have a much lower chance of hitting and will also be capped on damage. It is mandatory to hide behind a pillar, as failing to do so can result in fatal damage. Pillars will also collapse after several attacks and deal heavy damage to anyone next to them when it collapses.\n*After phase 1 is complete, Verzik will leave her throne and fly to the middle of the room. Players next to her have a chance of being bodyslammed away which stuns them, and she also tosses out bombs at the players' positions which deal heavy damage if they are not avoided. She can summon multiple Nylocas, including [[Nylocas Athanatos]] which will heal her and can be removed by attacking them once with a poisoned weapon to inflict a heavy poison hit before despawning. The common Nylocas will follow a player and explode if they reach their target for heavy damage, but will also explode after a set amount of time. As her health lowers, she will start using blood spells to heal her and periodically summon two [[Nylocas Matomenos]] which she will kill off if they persist too long, and heal her for the amount of health they had left. During the first three seconds after she summons them, any damage inflicted will heal her instead.\n[[File:Verzik Virtur transforms.gif|frame|Verzik Vitur transforms into a spider hybrid.]]\n*After phase 2 is complete, Verzik's true form will be shown, a half spider, half vampyre. She is now mobile and uses all three forms of combat, her ranged attack consisting of barbs and her magic a single blue projectile. She can still summon common Nylocas during the fight like in the previous phase, and uses new abilities. She can charge up a powerful attack, creating \"safespots\" which players can stand on to protect them from this attack. Each \"safespot\" only works for one player, so they cannot stand on the same tile to protect themselves. She can also go to the centre of the room and fling webs around the chamber, binding players if they are stuck on them. Trapped players can be set free by having other players attack the web, which has 10 health. Otherwise, they will be freed after a set amount of time but take heavy damage in the process. She can also launch a green projectile which must be bounced between every player of the team or the player who is targeted will take heavy damage. When she reaches 20% of her health, she will summon a purple magical tornado for each player in the room, which will constantly follow them. If they are hit by the tornado, they will take heavy damage, healing and empowering Verzik in the process. The tornado will also heal Verzik if a player dies to another attack.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=16 May 2019|update=Farming Improvements and Rebalancing Existing Content|change=A bug where Verzik would target a dead player was fixed.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"V\u00e9rzik\" directly translates to \"bleeding\" in Hungarian.\n*The concept of Verzik Vitur was inspired by the character Ursula from Disney's 1989 animated film ''{{WP|The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid}}''.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ghost|url=https://twitter.com/Jagex_Ghost/status/991773208356507648|date=2 May 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gKkoK|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=I love Ursula, she was definitely an inspiration :)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Succession|predecessor=[[TzKal-Zuk]]|title=[[Strongest monster|Strongest monster in ''RuneScape'']]|successor=Incumbent}}\n\n{{Theatre of Blood}}\n{{Vampyres}}\n{{A Taste of Hope}}",

It is a parasitic wasp from the Abyss that [[Xeric]] and his followers stumbled upon when attempting to open a new dimensional tear.\n\n==Strategy==\nUse [[Protect from Missiles]], and attack with [[Ranged]]. Vespula can [[poison]] players starting at 20 damage, so a [[serpentine helmet]] or another form of poison protection is highly recommended. In addition, septic tentacles will spawn near the entrance, dealing moderate poison damage (will not cause poison) to those who pass it once the fight starts.\n\nThe chamber contains [[lux grub]]s, which need to be fed [[medivaemia blossom]]s, which are also found in the same chamber. The grubs have a health bar, which will constantly degrade. If their health reaches 0, they will turn into [[vespine soldier]]s, fully healing both Vespula and the portal. For this reason, it is recommended that at least one member of the team focuses solely on feeding blossoms to the grubs.\n\nWhen Vespula reaches 20% of its health, she will stop flying, and can only be harmed with melee. During this time, the team should focus their attacks on the [[abyssal portal]]. [[Enchanted ruby bolts]] can be very effective against the portal. After a short time, Vespula will go back to flying, and the team should refocus on her. While it is possible to attack the portal at any time, it will cause Vespula to become enraged, using her stinger to attack anyone nearby for high damage. This can be avoided by staying away from melee distance or going under her, though doing the latter will cause rapid stomp damage of up to eight per tick instead. Whilst Vespula is enraged, the abyssal portal will drain the prayer points of players standing in range by three points every two ticks; if prayer points are already depleted, then three damage will applied instead.\n\nWhen the portal is destroyed, Vespula and the lux grubs will fall with it, ending the encounter.\n\nGenerally the most efficient strategy is to focus exclusively on damaging the portal with a long-range weapon, particularly a [[twisted bow]], or a [[powered staff]] set on long-range. With 90+ [[Hitpoints]], players using [[Redemption]] are safe for the most part, as all damage (when properly done) comes from the stomp damage which is too low to kill outright, provided that Redemption is active. Players have to stand on a specific tile to avoid damage from Vespula's melee attacks, which deal much higher damage \u2014 it is diagonal from the lux grub closest to the portal, away from it \u2014 and click on the portal to attack, then retreat to the 'safe' spot while waiting for the next attack. Due to Prayer frequently draining to zero with this method, it is highly recommended to get a [[Prayer enhance (+)]] potion before entering the room. [[Stamina potion]] is also required due to the constant running, and an antipoison is recommended for mistakes.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Transdimensional notes|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Xeric's aid (+)(4)|Quantity=2|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Revitalisation (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Prayer enhance (+)(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=31 January 2019|update=Chambers of Xeric, Kebos, and Collection Log Changes|change=<nowiki/>\n*Previously, Vespula could start unhatching the grubs if the room was loaded while the party was completing a previous room.

Like other bosses in the [[Wilderness]], he can also drop the [[dragon pickaxe]].\n\nVet'ion has two forms: the (purple) regular form and the (orange) reborn form. After he is defeated in his first form, he will go to his second form. His stats or abilities do not change between forms. If he is not killed within five minutes in his second form, he will revert to his first form with the same [[hit points]]. If he reverts after his hellhounds have been killed, the player(s) will not have to kill them a second time.\n\nUnlike the other Wilderness bosses, Vet'ion's lethal attack has a cooldown and as such cannot be used in quick succession.\n\nAccording to [[Andros Mai]], Vet'ion's power comes from his resting place, which has yet to appear in-game.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Vet'ion/Strategies}}\nVet'ion is highly resistant to any combat style other than [[crush]], and as he is [[undead]], he is susceptible to [[Salve amulet]] and its [[Salve amulet (e)|enhanced]] version. He is immune to [[magic]] damage, but spells with effects such as [[Vulnerability]] still work on him.\n\nVet'ion primarily uses a [[melee]] that can target players up to three tiles away from him. He also frequently uses an unblockable but avoidable [[magical]] attack that launches three lightning bolts, one at the targeted player and two randomly somewhere nearby. Lastly, he may smash his scimitar on the ground, causing an earthquake which deals up to 45 damage on all players within 6 tiles of him, though it's possible for the attack to deal no damage.\n\nHe's fought similarly to the [[Kalphite Queen]] in which he has two forms, a \"normal\" and \"reborn\" form. When he reaches half health in his first form for the first time, he summons two level 214 [[Skeleton Hellhound (Vet'ion)|Skeleton Hellhound]]s that attack with powerful melee, and must be killed as they grant him complete damage immunity while alive. In the second form, they become level 281 [[Greater Skeleton Hellhound]]s that are even stronger and must also be killed.\n\nLike the Kalphite Queen, if players don't kill his second form within 5 minutes, he'll revert back to his normal state.\n\n==Quotes==\nVet'ion will exclaim several quotes throughout the fight:\n\n*\"Kill, my pets!\" (when summoning Skeleton Hellhounds)\n*\"Do it again!!\" (when his first form is defeated)\n*\"Bahh! Go, Dogs!!\" (when summoning Greater Skeleton Hellhounds)\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ring of the gods|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/512}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=12/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ancient staff|Quantity=1|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon pickaxe|Quantity=1|Rarity=.75/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon 2h sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=.5/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=400|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=300|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=200|Rarity=7/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cannonball|Quantity=250|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=20 (noted)|Rarity=7/128|Raritynotes=<ref name=gem group=d>20 [[uncut rubies]] are dropped along 10 [[uncut diamond]]s.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut diamond|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=7/128|Raritynotes=<ref name=gem group=d />}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Gold ore|Quantity=300 (noted)|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Limpwurt root|Quantity=25 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Magic logs|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Oak plank|Quantity=300 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut dragonstone|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mort myre fungus|Quantity=200 (noted)|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Grimy ranarr weed|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=15000-19999|Rarity=19/128|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark crab|Quantity=8|Rarity=10/128|Raritynotes=<ref name=consumable group=d>Eight [[dark crab]]s are dropped along with three [[Super restore(4)]]'s.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Super restore(4)|Quantity=3|Rarity=10/128|Raritynotes=<ref name=consumable group=d />}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Sanfew serum(4)|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Ogre coffin key|Quantity=10 (noted)|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Supercompost|Quantity=100 (noted)|Rarity=4.75/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dark fishing bait|Quantity=375|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Palm tree seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Yew seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Magic seed|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Tertiary===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Looting bag|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Brimstone key|Quantity=1|Rarity={{Brimstone rarity|454}}|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Brimstone keys are only dropped while on a [[Slayer task]] given by [[Konar quo Maten]].</ref>|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Clue scroll (elite)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/100|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>The elite clue scroll drop rate increases to 1/50 if a [[ring of wealth (i)]] is worn.</ref>|AltRarity=1/50|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Long bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/400|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Vet'ion jr.|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/2000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Skeleton champion scroll|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5000|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Curved bone|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/5012.5|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Wilderness Slayer tertiary===\n{{WildernessSlayerDropTable|combat=454|hitpoints=255|boss=yes}}\n\n===Deadman mode===\n''The following drops and rarities only apply to [[Deadman Mode]].''\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(4)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(4) is a tertiary drop only found in the seasonal mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Saradomin brew(1)|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Saradomin brew(1) is a tertiary drop only found in the tournament mode.</ref>|nosmw=yes}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=6 August 2015|update=XP Drops, Jad Pet & Slayer|change=Vet'ion is no longer able to take damage when lured far enough away from his dogs.}}\n{{Subject changes|date=30 July 2015|update=Custom F-Keys & Music Cape|change=A game engine bug affecting the retaliation of ranging/maging NPCs has been fixed.

When you first enter his room, Viyeldi pretends to be a [[Blue hat (Legends' Quest)|hat]] on the ground until picked up. Upon beginning a conversation with him, he informs you of a different path you could take in the quest. You can choose to carry out Nezikchened's request, and kill Viyeldi using the [[Dark dagger]] that Echned Zekin gives you at the source of the holy water spring, or you could listen to him, and kill the warriors for the fragments of the [[Heart crystal]] to progress.\n\nKilling Viyeldi, while quicker, results in a more difficult final fight, as you will have to defeat the three warriors [[San Tojalon]], [[Irvig Senay]], and [[Ranalph Devere]] alongside Nezikchened in the fight. You can avoid this if you listen to Viyeldi and give the dagger to [[Ungadulu]] instead, and kill the warriors. Ungadulu will also give you a [[Holy force]] card to use against Nezikchened and weaken him in the next two fights.\n\nIf you do kill Viyeldi with the dagger, then you can still give the [[glowing dagger]] to Ungadulu to receive the holy force card. Just remember that this route results in the three warriors appearing in the final battle. Whichever option you take, be prepared to fight the demon after this section of the quest.

Created by [[Zorgoth]] during the [[Fourth Age]]'s {{RSL|Dragonkin Conflicts}}, the blue dragon is one of his subjects that has survived his experiments in the laboratory beneath the [[dragonkin]] fortress on [[Ungael]]. Despite its phenomenal strength, Zorgoth abandoned this Vorkath on [[Ungael]] due to its lack of aggression, leaving it as a \"distraction\" for any humans that would stumble onto the island.\n\nThe [[quest]] variant of Vorkath is somewhat weaker than his post-quest counterpart; however, both share the same attacks. After the quest, a stronger variant of Vorkath may be fought.\n\nVorkath is considered a [[blue dragon]] for the purpose of a [[Slayer task]]. As Vorkath is also [[undead]], the [[Salve amulet]] and its variants will work on him. However, it does not stack with the [[Slayer helmet]]. Rings of recoil do not inflict damage on Vorkath.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Vorkath/Strategies}}\n\nVorkath uses a variety of attacks, primarily [[ranged]] and [[magical]] attacks, as well as [[melee]] if standing next to him. Similarly to the [[King Black Dragon]], he can also use three types of [[dragonfire]]: regular, [[venomous]], and [[prayer]]-disabling kind. His dragonfire is stronger than other [[dragons]]' and requires more tiers of protection to block. The final common attack is a fireball he launches high in the air that must be dodged or it will deal substantial damage.\n[[File:Fighting Vorkath.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fighting Vorkath on Ungael.]]\nOccasionally (after six normal/dragonfire attacks), he will use one of two special attacks and alternate between them:\n\n*Freezing the player in place and summoning a [[Zombified Spawn]] that will approach the player and explode violently if not killed, resulting in up to 61 damage\n*Launching acid pools around the area and rapidly spitting fireballs at the player that must be dodged or they will deal high damage very quickly\n\nOnce Vorkath is killed, he will return to his original dead stance. If [[Dragon Slayer II]] is completed, he can immediately be re-woken for another battle.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Drops==\n''In addition to the 100% drops, the player will also have two rolls on Vorkath's drop table, excluding tertiary items, which have only one roll.

A [[spiny helmet]]\u00a0or [[Slayer helmet]] is required to start fighting one. Players without 5 [[Defence]] would not be [[Slayer task|assigned]] these as 5 Defence is required to wear the helmet. This monster is not very popular, due to the fact that its drops are poor with the exception of the [[mystic hat]]. It is found only in the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]. Be sure to bring a rope and a [[light source]].\n\nThis creature is infamous for surprising, and sometimes killing, low-level players who are traversing through the Lumbridge Swamp Caves. To avoid the Wall beasts, simply run past the \"Hole in the walls\", avoiding the tile they are adjacent to. Wall beasts can be a good source of [[Grimy guam leaf|guams]] due to the fact that it's the only [[herb]] they drop.\n\n==Strengths and Weaknesses==\nPlayers should wear a [[spiny helmet]] or [[slayer helmet]] whilst fighting wall beasts, otherwise they will grab them by the head and slam them against the wall, removing up to 18 hitpoints.\n\nIf players wear a spiny helmet, the grabbing attack will fail, allowing them to be fought normally. A wall beast's maximum hit on a player wearing a spiny helmet is 4. You may also wear the [[slayer helmet]], as it is combined with the spiny helmet.\n\nThe spiny helmet is only required to initiate combat with a wall beast. Once it has started attacking normally, it can no longer grab the player's head, allowing a [[black mask]] to be used.\n\nThe wall beast does not count as a large monster and therefore the [[dragon halberd]]'s special attack does not produce two hits on it.\n\nThe best location to slay these is in the southwest corner of the dungeon where there are two spawns located extremely close to one another. It is easy and effective to simply run back and forth between each spawn after completing a kill.\n\nIn addition, you can quickly make a beast reappear by leaving the dungeon and entering it again, making the beast located west of the entrance available to slay again.\n\nAlternatively, if players start an uninterruptible animation during the death animation of the wall beast, it will respawn instantly after the animation completes.

You will run right past them!\n*Killing one Wall Beast will reset the spawn on the others, so place yourself near two different holes if not using the rope trick described above.\n*They are located in the Lumbridge swamp caves, so remember to bring a [[light source]]. A [[Bullseye lantern]] is optimal, as an open\u00a0light source\u00a0(such as a\u00a0candle\u00a0or a\u00a0torch) can ignite dangerous swamp gas, resulting in an explosion, dealing heavy damage and extinguishing the light source.\n*Players may wish to bring an [[antipoison]] in case they accidentally attack a [[cave slime]] or a [[cave crawler]], which are [[Poison|poisonous]].\n*This monster has the highest hitpoints of any monster under level 50.\n\n{{Slayer monsters}}\n{{Lumbridge Swamp Caves}}",

They are moderately resistant to all forms of combat with the exception of crush attacks, which they are significantly more vulnerable against. They use a magic attack whose projectile resembles [[Water Blast]], along with a [[magical ranged]] attack resembling [[ice arrows]].\n\n[[Duradel]] and [[Konar quo Maten]] are the only Slayer masters who assign waterfiends, and are a rare assignment. To unlock waterfiends as a task, players must have at least level 75 [[combat]], and have entered the [[Ancient Cavern]] at least once.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/713721069136449537|date=26 March 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/Nfhn7|archivedate=3 August 2019|quote=Scabarites: Most of the Contact quest.

Elves: Regicide quest.|name=Slayer task requirements tweet}}\n\nKilling a waterfiend is a requirement for an [[Clue scroll (elite)|elite clue scroll]].\n\n==Strategies==\nThe simplest way to reach waterfiends is by accessing the [[Ancient Cavern]], found south of the [[Barbarian Outpost]]. A games necklace allows for easy trips to the bank.\n\nBecause waterfiends use both magic and ranged, circumventing all of their damage through protection prayers is not possible. However, both of their attacks are rolled against the player's total magic resistance. Therefore, only armour to provide magic defence bonus, such as [[Dragonhide armour|dragonhide]] or [[Karil the Tainted's equipment|Karil's armour]], is helpful when fighting waterfiends.\n\nUsing crush attacks is ideal for dealing damage. If a crush weapon is not available, some high level weapons, such as the [[Saradomin sword]] and the [[leaf-bladed battleaxe]], possess a secondary crush attack which is sufficient given the very low crush defence bonus of waterfiends.\n\nAlternatively, ranged is also effective as most magic-resistant armour also provides a substantial ranged attack bonus. \n\nUsing [[Protect from Missiles]] is recommended for those struggling to defend against waterfiends. Players should also consider including Mystic Might in their quick-prayers for the added magic bonus.\n\nRegardless, players should also consider bringing high-healing foods (i.e. [[sharks]], [[tuna potatoes]], [[anglerfish]]) in order to prolong their stay.\n\nMany of the waterfiends' drops are ideal for casting [[High Level Alchemy]] on.\n\nYou can safe spot waterfiends across the river using range.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|jagex=yes}}\n\n{{Average drop value}}\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mist battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/3000}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Weapons and armour===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Staff of water|Quantity=1|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant chainbody|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Adamant warhammer|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune med helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water battlestaff|Quantity=1|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mystic water staff|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blue d'hide vambraces|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Rune full helm|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Runes and ammunition===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Sapphire bolts|Quantity=15|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril arrow|Quantity=90|Rarity=10/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Water rune|Quantity=150|Rarity=6/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Blood rune|Quantity=17|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Death rune|Quantity=23|Rarity=5/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mist rune|Quantity=25-75|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mud rune|Quantity=75-100|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Steam rune|Quantity=40-60|Rarity=2/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Materials===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril ore|Quantity=10-20 (noted)|Rarity=4/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw lobster|Quantity=18 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Raw shark|Quantity=8 (noted)|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Shark|Quantity=2|Rarity=3/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Mithril bar|Quantity=10-15 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut sapphire|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut emerald|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut ruby|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Uncut diamond|Quantity=3 (noted)|Rarity=1/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Herbs===\n{{HerbDropTable|9/128}}\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{HerbDropTable2|9/128}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Seeds===\n{{RareSeedDropTable|4/128|override=There is a 4/128 chance of rolling the [[rare seed drop table]].

They appear as normal humans until they are attacked in which they transform into level 88 werewolves, unless the player wields a [[wolfbane|wolfbane dagger]], in which case they remain human. In either case they drop [[wolf bones]]. They can hit up to 8 as a werewolf, and up to 2 as a human. If you are a lower level player (70-) training on them you may want food as their attacks are accurate.\n\nThey only count towards [[Slayer task]]s when killed in the werewolf form, not their human forms. There is a strategy that can work to reduce damage when killing these for slayer, though. Start the fight with the [[wolfbane dagger]] equipped, then when the werewolf's health is low, switch to a different weapon. It will regain 38 health in the transformation to wolf form, but still be low, and will ultimately cause less damage than fighting as a wolf the entire time. Another way to safely complete a werewolf slayer task is to set up a Dwarf Cannon in the village, run into a house, and close the door. The Werewolves will agro to you and stack up at the door, but as you are not taking damage through the closed door, the cannon will target all of them. You will need to run outside only occasionally to reload the cannon. Sometimes the Werewolves would stack up in a single file at the door, this makes it difficult for the Cannon to target. Moving around inside the house would spread them out and solve this problem.\n\nYou can safespot werewolves over the [[STASH unit|STASH]] in the middle of the village, if you stand behind the bar in the pub in [[Canifis]], or across the two tables. There are 4 werewolves inside the bar.\n\nNote if you are safespotting; you will stop attacking when the human turns to the werewolf form.\n\nWerewolves can also be found permanently in their werewolf form in the [[God Wars Dungeon]] (and [[Wilderness God Wars Dungeon|Wilderness version]]). These are slightly stronger than their Canifis variant, and are aligned with [[Zamorak]].

When it's a wolf, it's final form, it is called \"'''Experiment (fourth form)'''\". This doesn't apply to its skavid form however, it's simply referred to as \"'''Experiment'''\".\n*While the quest is active, players can take on the Experiment as many times as they wish.

Players can get there quickly by using the [[fairy ring]] {{fairycode|cir}} located south of the mountain. As they are only found within the volcano, players must wear the [[boots of stone]], [[boots of brimstone]] or [[granite boots]] to protect themselves from the extreme heat of the dungeon floor. Additionally, players that have completed the [[elite Kourend & Kebos Diary]] can wear any type of footwear, or no footwear, without being rapidly burned.\n\nWyrms were an ancient race of [[dragons]], said to be capable of destroying cities and armies on their own. They slowly disappeared due to their heavy involvement in the [[God Wars]]. The current Wyrms in the dungeon are an attempted recreation of the powerful Wyrms of old by a [[Dragonkin]] named [[Karuulm]].\n\nWyrms do '''NOT''' require any form of [[dragonfire protection]]. When encountered, they will be slithering on the ground. However, once attacked, they will levitate off the ground and attack the player. Wyrms attack with both [[Melee]] and [[Magic]]; however, if attacked from a distance, they will only use their magic attack. This makes the [[Ranged]] attack style while using a form of magic protection, such as [[Protect from Magic]], or armour with high magic defence bonuses like [[dragonhide armour|dragonhide]], a viable method for killing Wyrms. High level players (70+ [[Defence]]) should be just fine with [[food]] and [[Karil's armour]].\n\nThey are the only monster to drop the [[dragon sword]] and [[dragon harpoon]].\n\nWyrms are vulnerable to the effects of [[Dragonbane weapons]].\n\nIf on a Slayer Task, any idle Wyrms on the eastern alcove of the second island can be attacked and then lured to the corner to trap them, allowing players to range them at a specific spot while staying out of their magic attack range. Players will occasionally need to re-engage the Wyrm in combat as it will return to its idle state after being unable to retaliate for several hits.\n\n==Drops==\n{{DropLogProject|kills=847282}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:wyrmOntask|{{#expr:\n(1/2000) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon sword}} +\n(1/2000) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon harpoon}} +\n(1/2000) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Dragon knife}} +\n(1/2000) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Dragon thrownaxe}}\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:wyrmOfftask|{{#expr:\n(1/10000) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon sword}} +\n(1/10000) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon harpoon}} +\n(1/10000) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Dragon knife}} +\n(1/10000) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Dragon thrownaxe}}\n}}}}<!--\n\n-->{{#vardefine:onewyrmLoot|{{#expr:\n\n1*{{GEP|Wyrm bones}} +\n\n{{#vardefineecho:wyrmReg|{{#expr:\n(10/76) * 200 * {{GEP|Fire rune}} +\n(10/76) * 112.5 * {{GEP|Earth rune}} +\n(5/76) * 17.5 * {{GEP|Soul rune}} +\n(5/76) * 27.5 * {{GEP|Blood rune}} +\n(3/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Red d'hide chaps}} +\n(2/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Adamant axe}} +\n(2/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Adamant sq shield}} +\n(2/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Adamant battleaxe}} +\n(2/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Adamant 2h sword}} +\n(2/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune med helm}} +\n(1/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Earth battlestaff}} +\n(1/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Rune battleaxe}} +\n(1/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Dragon dagger}} +\n(4/76 * 32/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy guam leaf}} +\n(4/76 * 24/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy marrentill}} +\n(4/76 * 18/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy tarromin}} +\n(4/76 * 14/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy harralander}} +\n(4/76 * 11/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy ranarr weed}} +\n(4/76 * 8/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy irit leaf}} +\n(4/76 * 6/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy avantoe}} +\n(4/76 * 5/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy kwuarm}} +\n(4/76 * 4/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy cadantine}} +\n(4/76 * 3/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy lantadyme}} +\n(4/76 * 3/128) * 1.5 * {{GEP|Grimy dwarf weed}} +\n\n(3/76 * 47/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Toadflax seed}} +\n(3/76 * 32/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Irit seed}} +\n(3/76 * 31/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Belladonna seed}} +\n(3/76 * 22/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Poison ivy seed}} +\n(3/76 * 22/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Avantoe seed}} +\n(3/76 * 21/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Cactus seed}} +\n(3/76 * 15/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Potato cactus seed}} +\n(3/76 * 15/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Kwuarm seed}} +\n(3/76 * 10/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Snapdragon seed}} +\n(3/76 * 7/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Cadantine seed}} +\n(3/76 * 5/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Lantadyme seed}} +\n(3/76 * 4/238) * 3 * {{GEP|Snape grass seed}} +\n(3/76 * 3/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Dwarf weed seed}} +\n(3/76 * 2/238) * 1 * {{GEP|Torstol seed}} +\n\n(8/76) * 1200 * 1 +\n(7/76) * 1 * {{GEP|Bass}} +\n(3/76) * 250 * {{GEP|Pure essence}} +\n(2/76) * 10 * {{GEP|Rune arrowtips}} +\n(2/76) * 10 * {{GEP|Adamant arrowtips}} +\n(1/76) * 1 * {{GDTValue}}\n}}}}\n}} }}\n\nThe average wyrm kill, including [[wyrm bones]] and its unique drops, is worth either {{Coins|floor({{#var:onewyrmLoot}}+{{#var:wyrmOfftask}})}} when you are not on a wyrm [[Slayer task]], or {{Coins|floor({{#var:onewyrmLoot}}+{{#var:wyrmOntask}})}} when you are on a wyrm slayer assignment.\n\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Wyrm bones|Quantity=1|Rarity=Always}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Pre-roll===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon sword|Quantity=1|Rarity=1/10000|Raritynotes=<ref name=wyrmunique group=d>The rarity changes to 1/2,000 while on a wyrm [[Slayer task]].</ref>{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Munro|url=https://twitter.com/JagexMunro/status/1095752074099339264|date=13 February 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.md/JY7vY|archivedate=9 March 2020|quote=As I mentioned on the Q & A, here are the pictures of the drop rates for various parts of Kebos.

This can be temporarily halted by standing on top of the exhumed remains.\n*Poison (Phase 2): Xarpus starts attacking the players after enough time has passed from phase 1 and starts off with the amount of health he had starting from phase 1. He will launch poison at players which lightly damages anyone in a 3x3 grid centred around the player Xarpus was focusing. This poison then occupies that tile for the rest of the fight and deals 6-8 damage each tick a player stands on or crosses over it. Skipping over a poisoned tile will deal a delayed hit.\n*Counter (Phase 3): Xarpus screeches once lowered below 22.5% of its health and stops launching poison around the arena, instead staring intently at one quadrant at a time. If a player attacks it from the area Xarpus is looking at, it will retaliate with a poison attack equal to <math>\\frac{1}{2} * AttackersDamage + 50</math> for each attack performed by the player.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes|date=16 May 2019|update=Farming Improvements and Rebalancing Existing Content|change=The difficulty of phase 1 was reduced, especially for solo-trio teams.}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Yarasa\", the species that Xarpus is classified as, means \"bat\" in Turkish.\n*When examined, the acidic miasma that Xarpus shoots at the players reads \"''Tread softly because you tread on miasma''\".

It appears first in [[TzHaar Fight Cave#Maps & Wave Breakdown|Wave 15]]. It resembles a very tall, lizard-like humanoid. Its [[melee]] attack is a powerful slash from its claws that hits up to 28 [[hitpoints]]. The Yt-MejKot also has the ability to heal up to 10 of both its own hitpoints and those of any other monsters around it once the targets drops below half health.\n\nThese are large monsters and are easily blocked by other monsters or the rocks in the cave. Yt-MejKots appear to only heal themselves whilst below half health, so it is very likely they will not heal at all if you are [[Ranged|ranging]] them from a [[TzHaar Fight Cave#Tips|safespot]]. Yt-MejKots are a good source for healing hitpoints if the player has [[Guthan the Infested's equipment|Guthan's]] equipment, due to the fact they recover their life points using their ability.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Yt-MejKot, in the Tzhaar language, could be translated as \"Cold-Mage-Protect\" or \"Dead-Priest-Save\". \"Yt\" in TzHaar is cold, freeze, or dead. Yt-MejKot looks like a lizard, and lizards are cold blooded. \"Mej\" means priest or mage. In this case, it's probably a priest as the old examine text is \"Holy Reptile...\". \"Kot\" means save or protect. Yt-MejKot heal themselves and other nearby Fight Caves creatures, so they are protecting and saving them.\n*They seem to heal themselves every 2 attacks they use, but this tends to occur only when meleeing them or standing very close to them.\n\n{{TzHaar Fight Cave}}",

Being immune to traditional combat damage, players must use their [[Mining]], [[Smithing]] and [[Runecraft]] skills to create [[imbued tephra]] capable of destroying her stone armour. Once her armour has been destroyed, they must damage her by mining her with a [[pickaxe]].\n\nZalcano's prison can be accessed from Prifddinas' [[Prifddinas#Trahaearn district|Trahaearn district]] via a teleport platform just west of the south-eastern [[bank]]. As Prifddinas requires completion of [[Song of the Elves]] to access, Zalcano requires a minimum of 70 [[Mining]] and [[Smithing]] to be fought, though higher levels in Mining, Smithing and Runecraft will be advantageous, as well as higher [[Hitpoints]] to withstand her various attacks. All of Zalcano's attacks are [[typeless]], meaning that armour and protection prayers cannot be used to reduce their chance of dealing damage or the damage itself.\n\n==History==\nZalcano is a demon and [[Skotizo]]'s sister, who both held the rank of general in Zamorak's armies. During the [[God Wars]], when [[Zamorak]] personally sent [[Skotizo]] and his squad to recover an artefact in the [[Karamjan Temple]], Skotizo eagerly took the mission only to betray his squad and took the artefact for himself, escaping to [[Zeah|a certain continent]] far west. Zamorak held Zalcano personally responsible for her brother's treachery, and cursed her to slowly turn to stone, which would only be lifted if she brought her brother back to him.\n\nBelieving that Skotizo had fled to the elven lands of [[Tirannwn]], Zalcano made her way there. The elves initially believed she was the first of many demons to attack their city, but to their surprise, she was the only one and roamed the forests as if she was looking for something. Amlodd mystics soon learned a curse was slowly turning her to stone, and this prompted the Trahaearn Clan to capture her for study. The Ithell and Trahaearn Clans worked together to create a prison in the volcanic caverns to keep her in the city, and successfully captured her, albeit with many casualties.\n[[File:Zalcano's prison.png|thumb|220px|left|Zalcano, imprisoned beneath the crystal city.]]\nFollowing her capture, the curse accelerated, with an elf believing it to be the result of Zamorak already knowing she had failed her mission. With the help of Amlodd magic and Meilyr potions, the elves learned why she came to Tirannwn.\n\nThough she had appeared to have slowly descended into madness, the elves dared not to release her as they had lost many of their brethren luring her inside and did not want her power to grow unchecked. The aforementioned elf returned many years later to personally see the demon they were studying, and was surprised when she talked, simply muttering the name \"Skotizo\".\n\nToday, she remains in Prifddinas, and the Trahaearn elves who study her often require aid in keeping her in check.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n==Attacks==\nWhile the player is inside the prison, Zalcano has six different attacks that the player must watch out for as they attempt to take on the stone demon. Each of the attacks are performed at random intervals throughout the fight.\n\n*Zalcano will stomp on the ground, causing boulders to fall from the ceiling. These are easily avoided by stepping at least one tile away. Boulders can be easily spotted by watching out for the falling pebbles/dirt, which will be followed by the falling boulder. It is also easy to know which tile they are falling onto by the location of their shadow on the ground. Players who are hit by these can take 40+ damage.\n[[File:Fighting Zalcano.png|thumb|280px|Throwing imbued tephra while standing under a blue demonic symbol will increase the player's accuracy and damage.]]\n[[File:Mining Zalcano.png|thumb|280px|A player mines Zalcano after breaking her stone armour.]]\n*Zalcano will summon blue and orange demonic symbols. If a player is standing on a blue demonic symbol when attacking Zalcano with [[imbued tephra]], it will increase the players accuracy and damage significantly. The orange demonic symbols, however, should be avoided, These will damage the player as well as reduce their run energy if they pass through it or stand in it. Damage is dealt constantly if a player stands within it and can result in a quick death if they are not paying attention.\n*Zalcano will summon a golem in the southern part of the prison. If the golem reaches her, it will restore her armour's health based on the health of the Golem. If the Golem is at full health, it will restore 50 hitpoints towards her armour. It is possible for a player to hurt the golem with the [[imbued tephra]]. The golem will also drop 16-24 imbued tephra when killed.\n*Zalcano will fire a red ball of energy at the current glowing red rock formation to deactivate it, changing its location. If a player is standing near the rock formation when this happens, they will take 24+ damage. These can be avoided by walking away from the rock.\n*After Zalcano has fallen and players have caused her damage, she will rise again. If any players are standing next to her while this occurs, she will create a shockwave push them back, causing the player small amounts of damage. All tephra are destroyed as well.\n*Zalcano will randomly hit all players within the prison with a barrage of small pebbles. These are not avoidable, but players will only take a few hitpoints worth of damage.\n\nPlayers will also get damaged if they stand under Zalcano when she has fallen. Damage rate is much less than an orange symbol, dealing around 3-10 damage per tick, and the danger persists until Zalcano begins to rise again.\n\n==Drops==\nPlayers must do at least 30 damage to Zalcano's hitpoints and 30 damage to her shield to be eligible for drops, and 50 damage to be eligible for uniques/pet.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Lenny|url=https://twitter.com/JagexLenny/status/1188830719419785222|date=28 October 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.md/Mi4UY|archivedate=19 November 2019|quote=Yeah, 50 armour and 50 health would reach the minimum contribution.

'''Similar to other untradeable items, they are meant to turn into coins; however, as they have a value of zero, they simply disappear. When doing a hard clue involving a Zamorak wizard encounter, this is easy to avoid, as you only need 3 items: a weapon (slashing [[Teleport lever|if you need to cut a web]]), the clue scroll, and [[spade]]. If you bring more than 3/[[Protect Item|4]] items and are attacked by a [[PKer]], you should quickly drop items that you don't care about compared to the clue scroll (such as the spade).\n\nWith 70+ [[Strength]] and a 1-dose [[combat potion]], using four [[special attack]]s from the [[Dragon dagger]] and relevant [[prayers]] should kill them almost every time, and if not they can be easily finished.\n\nZamorak wizards are substantially weaker than [[Saradomin wizard]]s. Zamorak wizards are not [[poison]]ous, have low health, low defence (except against [[Magic]]), and attack exclusively with Magic (using [[Flames of Zamorak]]). As such, activating [[Protect from Magic]] completely negates their damage. Since they have very little [[Defence]], [[melee]] and [[Ranged]] are both effective in dispatching them. If you use Ranged, it is advisable to use a [[Crystal bow]] or [[Toxic blowpipe]] as they require no carried ammunition that would protect over the clue scroll.

Also, [[poison]] works full power, so [[super poison|p++]] weapons might be good against them.\n\nThey can also infect you with [[Disease]], but you may counteract this with [[Relicym's balm]] or [[Sanfew serum]], which may be bought from [[Uglug Nar]] outside Jiggig for 200 [[coins]] (Relicym's balm only), or made using [[Herblore]].

It is found next to the ladder leading to the current floor alongside several [[shade]]s. It is worth noting that [[combat]] experience gained while fighting the zombie is drastically reduced; the player will gain 1 experience for 10 damage dealt.\n\nAs it is undead, it is affected by the [[Salve amulet]] and [[Crumble Undead]].\n\nThe zombie can be [[safespot]]ted using a skeleton found on the eastern side in the middle northern part of the room.\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[random event]] update in [[2014]], the zombie used to appear randomly when burying [[bones]]. On appearance, it would say \"Brainsssss!\". As with similar guardian random events, the zombie's [[combat level]] and stats scaled with the player's combat level, as well as only being attackable by the targeted player.\n\nThese zombies were somewhat rare, as [[members]] rarely buried bones in high enough quantities to activate this random event. Also, [[Prayer]] had two other random events that could occur while training it: [[Shade (random event)|Shades]] and [[Leo the Gravedigger]]. Zombies would not appear if training Prayer via the [[Ectofuntus]] or a [[Gilded altar|POH altar]].\n\n==Drops==\n===100%===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Big bones|Quantity=1-7,10|Rarity=Always|Raritynotes=<ref group=d>Big bones are always dropped in varying quantities.</ref>}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Runes===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Air rune|Quantity=40|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Cosmic rune|Quantity=5|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Chaos rune|Quantity=35,50|Rarity=Uncommon}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n\n===Other===\n{{DropsTableHead}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Fishing bait|Quantity=27,50|Rarity=Common}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Coins|Quantity=26|Rarity=Rare|gemw=No}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Bones|Quantity=3,9,10|Rarity=Varies|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=bones>Bones and dragon bones can be dropped alongside the 100% drop (big bones) in members worlds.</ref>}}\n{{DropsLine|Name=Dragon bones|Namenotes={{(m)}}|Quantity=1-3|Rarity=Varies|Raritynotes=<ref group=d name=bones />}}\n{{DropsTableBottom}}\n{{Reflist|group=d}}\n\n===Rare drop table===\n{{RareDropTable/Sandbox}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The zombie takes a minute to [[respawn]].\n\n{{Discontinued random events}}\n[[Category:Undead]]",

The crypts were constructed long before the founding of [[Great Kourend]] 1,510 years ago, but within the last few hundred years were overrun by zombies and skeletons.\n\nThere are three types of zombies found in the crypts, with each variant attacking with a different combat style. Because of their high maximum hit and the fact that the crypts are a [[multicombat area]], fighting these zombies can be quite difficult.

During the fight, Vorkath will occasionally freeze the player and summon a Zombified Spawn. Vorkath becomes immune to damage during this. The spawn makes its way towards the player, and if it reaches them, it will explode and deal up to 60 damage (30 during [[Dragon Slayer II]]). It can be killed before this to negate any damage. In either scenario, the player will become unfrozen after the spawn dies and may continue attacking Vorkath.\n\nSince this spawn deals a lot of damage, it is recommended to cast [[Crumble Undead]] on the spawn, as it is guaranteed to instantly kill it. If the player has a very low Magic attack bonus (-64 or lower), there is a chance the cast will splash and deal no damage; it is recommended to have -63 or higher as it becomes extremely unlikely to miss.\n\nIf the explosion occurs, it will deal damage based on how many hitpoints the spawn had left upon explosion; because of this, a risky but alternative method to killing Vorkath is to manually kill the spawn with either a [[blowpipe]] or [[Trident of the swamp|trident]], since even if the player fails to kill the spawn, it will usually be damaged enough to make the explosion damage negligible. When ranging, this can be used as a fallback should the player misclick on the Crumble Undead cast without having time to attempt another.\n\nIt is recommended to click away from Vorkath or do an action that interrupts attacking (such as eating) when it freezes the player, as otherwise the player will continue attacking it, which may cause a crucial delay before being able to attack the spawn and allow it to come close enough to explode.\n\nIf Vorkath dies after sending out the spawn (by being hit by an attack that was cast before freezing the player), the spawn will not die and continues approaching the player. However, upon reaching them, it will die without dealing any damage.\n\n{{Vorkath}}\n{{Dragon Slayer II}}\n[[Category:Quest monsters]]",

Players can only harm it with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]; though Zulrah can be reached with a halberd, it is immune to melee attacks. In order to access Zulrah, players must have completed [[Regicide]] to the point of reaching [[Port Tyras]].\n\nBefore the player can fight Zulrah, they must speak with [[High Priestess Zul-Harcinqa]] first and offer themselves as the sacrifice in place of the [[sacrifice|gnome child]], as [[Priestess Zul-Gwenwynig|Zul-Gwenwynig]] will prevent the player from boarding the boat until Zul-Harcinqa allows them to be the sacrifice.\n\nZulrah's gender is ambiguous; the High Priestess as well as [[slayer masters]] refer to it as male, while the examine text of Zulrah's [[boss lair display]] refers to it as female.\n\n==History==\nAs described in the [[stained journal]], Zulrah was created during the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]] as an experiment by an unnamed [[dragonkin]] living in the [[Poison Waste]]. Originally seen as one of many failures, Zulrah was discarded into the swamp, where it grew into an unexpectedly powerful and intelligent serpent. It was found once again by its dragonkin creator, who named it \"Zulrah\" before eventually being eaten by its own creation.\n\nSometime during the [[Fifth Age]], [[High Priestess Zul-Harcinqa|Harcinqa]]'s mother, Harcinqa, her daughter, and [[Rentos]], her son, visited the Poison Waste. On 5th Bennath, a group of men, [[Ohn]], [[Mortarium]], [[Onan]], and several others, attempted to escape the elven clans by running south to the Poison Waste. With no food to eat, they attempted to fish for [[Sacred eel|eels]] in the swamp, to no avail. With no luck on catching food, they decide to camp out with the gnomes.\n\nTwo days after, Zulrah appeared during the night and ate five of Ohn's men before the group could get to their senses. The next day after that, Harcinqa's mother attracted Zulrah's attention with a giant campfire, and held out her son, Rentos, which it devoured immediately. The gnome woman was able to bargain a deal with Zulrah, promising to send it sacrifices and worshipping it as a god if it did not wipe the whole group out. Zulrah simply slithered back into the swamp. The next day, Ohn's men began catching eels, which was interpreted as Zulrah agreeing to the deal. As the village of [[Zul-Andra]] was quickly formed; coincidentally, the woman decided to call it Zulrah, which its Dragonkin creator had done thousands of years ago.\n\nAs a result, Zulrah is worshipped as a god, being given sacrifices at a whim; in return, it allows the village of Zul-Andra to stand.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Zulrah's_Shrine.png|thumb|300px|Zulrah's Shrine, with Zulrah's beginning phase shown.]]\nZulrah is located at a shrine east of [[Zul-Andra]]. Players can quickly get here by:\n* taking a [[charter ship]] to Port Tyras and then running south\n* using the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|BJS}} to the small island west of [[Zul-Andra]], and then leaping across the stepping stones (requires 76 [[Agility]], can be boosted)\n* using a [[Zul-andra teleport]] scroll\nAll of these methods require completion of [[Regicide]].\n\nZulrah's Shrine is accessed by boarding the sacrificial boat. Upon entering the shrine, a still scene of the shrine will be shown with a prompted dialogue. Zulrah will appear as soon as the player continues the dialogue or performs an action. The only way to escape from the shrine is by killing Zulrah, teleporting out, or dying.\n\nPlayers can spectate a fight using a telescope located on an island north of Zul-Andra, which is accessed by using the [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|DLR}}.\n\nWhen a player defeats Zulrah, the drops will be received under the player, much like [[cave kraken]]s. A [[Zul-andra teleport]] scroll will also be dropped near the player, which cannot be picked up but can be used to return to Zul-Andra. To fight Zulrah again after, the player must return to the shrine via the boat.\n\n==Fight overview==\n{{Main|Zulrah/Strategies}}\n[[File:Fighting Zulrah.png|thumb|300px|A player fighting Zulrah in its tanzanite form]]\nThe shrine is a small U-shaped island with two pillars in the middle corners, and Zulrah rotates in the swampy water around the island throughout the fight. It cannot be reached with melee (with the exception of [[halberd]]s to which it is immune), making Ranged and/or Magic necessary to fight it. Furthermore, it periodically switches forms that have varying resistance to Ranged and Magic, so using both is recommended. In turn, Zulrah attacks with Ranged and Magic, as well as an avoidable attack where it targets the player with its tail, depending on its form. It can also summon [[snakeling]]s, smaller versions of itself, on the platform to attack the player, along with toxic clouds that deal rapid damage if they stand in one.\n\nZulrah and its snakelings inflict [[venom]] with their attacks, an enhanced version of [[poison]] that increases its damage the longer it has affected the player, starting at 6 damage per hit and increasing up to 20. Standard poison protection will only reduce it to regular poison and will not grant any immunity; [[anti-venom]] or [[anti-venom+]] or wearing a [[serpentine helm]] are much more effective for eliminating and preventing venom.\n\n[[File:Zulrah Patterns.png|thumb|150px|An overview of the fight's patterns]]\nZulrah has different forms throughout the fight, distinguishable by its colour, which designates its attack style and weakness. It changes forms by diving into the swamp and resurfacing somewhere else, which it does periodically. It may spawn snakelings and toxic clouds in any form.\n\n*When Zulrah is green, it attacks with Ranged. It is weak to Magic.\n**At approximately 2 minutes, Zulrah will be in its green form and attack with alternating Ranged and Magic attacks (colloquially called \"Jad phase\").\n**If the fight takes a long time (3+ minutes), it is possible for Zulrah to be in its green form and attack randomly with Ranged and Magic.\n*When Zulrah is blue, it attacks with Ranged and Magic. It is weak to Ranged. Due to the Magic attacks being more common and more accurate, it is recommended to use [[Protect from Magic]].\n*When Zulrah is red, it uses a [[typeless]]\u00a0attack wherein it swings its tail at the player's position, which can be avoided by moving away; if it hits, it will deal heavy damage and [[Stun (status)|stun]] the player. It is more resistant to damage than in the other two forms, but Magic is typically more effective than Ranged.\n\nThe forms and when and where Zulrah spawns snakelings and toxic clouds is not random: there are four possible patterns for the fight that dictate what it will do next. It always starts in its green form and spawns toxic clouds to cover most of the arena, after which it is randomly chosen which of the four patterns the fight will be. Further information can be read on the [[Zulrah/Strategies|strategy article]].\n\n===Player death===\nUpon [[death]] at Zulrah, all items except the three most valuable will be held by the [[Priestess Zul-Gwenwynig|priestess]] at the Zul-Andra dock, who acts as an [[Item Retrieval Service]]. Items held by the priestess are '''permanently lost''' if the player dies an unsafe death before reclaiming them. Some [[Death#Exceptions|specific anomalies]] may occur with some items.\n\nCompletion of the elite [[Western Provinces diary]] grants the player one free daily resurrection at Zulrah which restores all stats and allows the player to continue the fight from the current point if they drop to 0 Hitpoints. This does not count as a death for purposes such as losing [[Ironman Mode|hardcore ironman]] status. After using the free resurrection, you must relog after the daily reward reset in order for the resurrection to work again.\n\n==Drops==\n''In addition to the 100% drops, the player will also have two rolls on Zulrah's drop table, excluding tertiary items, which have only one roll.
